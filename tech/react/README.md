# React

Well its time to get back into front end devlopment!  React lets you write in a standard and nice version of javascript then compiles that into current flavors. This lets us use all the nice things and still support old shit.  I knida love that.

These are my notes as I learn [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Dev Enviroment

- We need to use nmp so we need the newest version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  Install it.  After its installed run ``` sudo npm install -g npm ```
  
## Creating an react app

React has lots of setup. There is a project to do this for you. use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

```shell
npm install create-react-app -g

```
## Java Script

### ES5


### ES6



## Workflow

### Packager

Here we use npm

### Bundler

Webpack

### Compiler

Babel + Presets

### Dev Server

For local dev what are we going to use to run our code?
