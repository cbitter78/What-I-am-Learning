Brené Brown studies human connection -- our ability to empathize, belong, love. In a poignant, funny talk, she shares a deep insight from her research, one that sent her on a personal quest to know herself as well as to understand humanity. A talk to share."/>

This is a great conversation on connection and how shame prevents connection and vulnerability can enable it.

This talk struck me on many levels.  Give it a watch.  It will be 16 minutes well spent.
