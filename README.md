# What am I reading?

## Why?

In 2017 I found my self transforming from a Devloper where I would instruct a computer to do what I wanted into working with and motivating people.
I started to see the power of Teams and how a team can be greater then the sum of its parts.   I then began to re-think my craft.  I no longer needed to 
be a awesome devloper, though I still love it, and am not too bad.  Rather I need to shift my thinking and my actions to help others become amazing
Devlopers, Project Managers, Agle pratishanitors and Leaders.   


## Why git and not a blog?

I am a devloper at heart.  Git is amazing.  Markdown will due.  KISS,  Enough said.
