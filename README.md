# What am I reading?

## Why?

In 2017 I found my self transforming from a Developer where I would instruct a computer to do what 
I wanted, into working with and motivating people. I started to see the power of Teams and how a team
can be greater then the sum of its parts. I then began to re-think my craft.  I no longer needed to
be a awesome developer, though I still love it, and am not too bad. Rather I need to shift my thinking
and actions to help others become amazing Developers, DevOps Practitioners and Leaders.

This repo will hold a collection of media I have hread, watched or listen to. 
I will include my notes and thoughts.  This repo is for people who want to **learn their craft** and 
are interested in my perspective. I want to produce a file for each book / site / video / audio book
I find valuable to me and share it here. I have no intention of spoiling any books, or stomping on any copyrights.

**This reop is **NOT** a source of "cliffs notes" you can read through to become yet 
another __blog expert!__  If this is what you are after, go elsewhere.**


## Why git, not a blog?

I am a developer at heart.  Git is amazing.  Markdown will due.  KISS,  Enough said.

## What I have read?

### Dev Ops

DevOps is not a word, its not a T-shirt, it is not a buzz word. Though I am sure you may have
experanced all three of these versions of it.  

>"DevOps is more than just a fad or a new name for an old concept. Their work illustrates how DevOps
>can improve the state of the art in organizational design, software development culture, and systems architecture."
>â€”Baron Schwartz,

The books in this section are those I read to become a true devops practitioner.  I don't need a T-Shirt, LapTop sticker
or to use the buzz words. I just want a better way.

## How I work

After 22 years in technology I value work, though it may be mis-spelled,
or incomplete is more valuable in a git repo then it is on my laptop waiting for me
to release it to the world.  With that in mind you will see lots of commits here.
You may see some files that look like I am working on them.  That is because I am.
You will also notice I am commiting all my work directly to TRUNK.
This is deliberate and intentional. 

## How I read

I have grown up with the blessing of dyslexia.  Though this has aided me in some amazintg ways I stil struggel with reading.
I still sit down and read through quite a few paper books.  In this repo you may see referance to Audio Book and Kindle books.
Most of the time I buy the Audio, Kindle and Paper Copy.  I listen to the Audio Book, Highlight and take notes in the Kindel app.
Then from time to time I will highlight the best parts in the paperback, add a note and give it away.
Maybe now that I have this repo I can just include a QR Code?  :) 

## Contribute

I thought about how I might want to accept contributions to such a personal repo.  I finally landed on this:

- I will accept issues for media (books, audio books, blogs, publications, pod-casts, videos, etc) that you think I should take a look at. 
- I will create a markdown file for each media I consume.  There will be a section for other thoughts.  Fill free to add your contribution there.

If you would like to suggest other ways to contribute to this repo just reach out to me directly.
