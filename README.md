# What am I Learning?

## Why?

In 2017 I found my self transforming from a Developer where I would instruct a computer to do what 
I wanted, into working with and motivating people. I started to see the power of Teams and how a team
can be greater then the sum of its parts. I then began to re-think my craft.  I no longer needed to
be a awesome developer, though I still love it, and am not too bad. Rather I need to shift my thinking
and actions to help others become amazing Developers, DevOps Practitioners and Leaders.

This repo will hold a collection of media I have head, watched or listen to. 
I will include my notes and thoughts.  This repo is for people who want to **learn their craft** and 
are interested in my perspective. I want to produce a file for each book / site / video / audio book
I find valuable to me and share it here. I have no intention of spoiling any books, or stomping on any copyrights.

**This reop is **NOT** a source of "cliffs notes" you can read through to become yet 
another __blog expert!__  If this is what you are after, go elsewhere.**


## Why git, not a blog?

I am a developer at heart.  Git is amazing.  Markdown will due.  KISS,  Enough said.

## What I have read?

### Dev Ops

DevOps is not a word, its not a T-shirt, it is not a buzz word. Though I am sure you may have
experienced all three of these versions of it.  

>"DevOps is more than just a fad or a new name for an old concept. Their work illustrates how DevOps
>can improve the state of the art in organizational design, software development culture, and systems architecture."
>â€”Baron Schwartz,

The books in this section are those I read to become a true DevOps practitioner.  I don't need a T-Shirt, LapTop sticker
or to use the buzz words. I just want a better way.

- [The Goal](books/the_goal.md)
- [The Phoenix Project](books/the_phoenix_project.md)
- [The DevOps Handbook](books/the_devops_handbook.md)
- [The Unicorn Project](books/the_unicorn_project.md)
- [This American Life Pod Cast #561 The NUMMI Story](listen/nummi.md)


## Development

Books, Blogs and podcasts all developers should consume.  You will notice that lots of this thinking is OLD!
that is because great software development is not a new idea.

- [Things You Should Never Do](blogs/things_you_should_never_do.md)

## Project Management

I dislike the term Project Management.  I prefer to manage the flow of work in a project. Picture a long road with traffic lights.  Do we speed to each light?  Go, Stop, Go Faster! Stop?  Have you ever passed a car on the freeway and think you are a super efficient driver only to take the exit and that same car is right behind you at the light?  Who is more efficient? Anyone can hurry. Hurry does not get work done, it causes stress.  Above all we want to get work done.

Managing flow, is doing the Correct thing at the Correct time while keeping the most important thing the most important thing.  Every amazing project manager I have ever worked with has managed flow, not urgency.  Sure they used urgency when it was called for.  It makes sense to speed up a bit to make the green light.  However, at all times they managed flow using Focus, Organization, Standards, and regulating speed which includes speeding up or urgency and even slowing some work down.  The point is not to pass the traffic light.  Its to hit all Green lights..  Every one.  Because "Any Efficiency before a constraint is a illusion of progress" ~Eliyahu M. Goldratt

Some say "We don't want or need Project management".  Well, much like architecture, even if you don't want it you will have it. you can intentionally add architecture to your software or you will end up with the architecture of your software.  You can intentionally manage your projects or your projects will manage you.

See these books.  You can choose any order you like, however I think this order will help you.

- [The Goal](./the_goal.md)
- [Critical Chain](./critical_chain.md)
- [Beyond the Goal](./beyond_the_goal.md)
- [Rules of Flow](./rules_of_flow.md)
- [The Phoenix Project](./the_phoenix_project.md)
- [The Unicorn Project](./the_unicorn_project.md)
- [Team of Teams](./team_of_teams.md)
- [Making work visible](./making_work_visible.md)

## Want to suggest my next book?

I would love suggestions!  Just open an issue on this repo.

## How I work

After over 23 years in technology I value work, though it may be misspelled,
or incomplete is more valuable in a git repo then it is on my laptop waiting for me
to release it to the world.  With that in mind you will see lots of commits here.
You may see some files that look like I am working on them.  That is because I am.
You will also notice I am committing all my work directly to TRUNK.
This is deliberate and intentional.

## How I read

I have grown up with the blessing of dyslexia.  Though this has aided me in some amazing ways I still struggle with reading.
I still sit down and read through quite a few paper books.  In this repo you may see reference to Audio Book and Kindle books.
Most of the time I buy the Audio, Kindle and Paper Copy.  I listen to the Audio Book, Highlight and take notes in the Kindle app.
Then from time to time I will highlight the best parts in the paperback, add a note and give it away.
Maybe now that I have this repo I can just include a QR Code?  :)

## Contribute

I thought about how I might want to accept contributions to such a personal repo.  I finally landed on this:

- I will accept issues for media (books, audio books, blogs, publications, pod-casts, videos, etc) that you think I should take a look at.
- I will create a markdown file for each media I consume.  There will be a section for other thoughts.  Fill free to add your contribution there.

If you would like to suggest other ways to contribute to this repo just reach out to me directly.
