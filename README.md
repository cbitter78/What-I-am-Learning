# What am I Learning?

## Why?

In 2017 I found my self transforming from a Developer where I would instruct a computer to do what
I wanted, into working with and motivating people. I started to see the power of Teams and how a team
can be greater then the sum of its parts. I then began to re-think my craft.  I no longer needed to
be a awesome developer, though I still love it, and am not too bad. Rather I need to shift my thinking
and actions to help others become amazing Developers, DevOps Practitioners and Leaders.

This repo will hold a collection of media I have head, watched or listen to.
I will include my notes and thoughts.  This repo is for people who want to **learn their craft** and
are interested in my perspective. I want to produce a file for each book / site / video / audio book
I find valuable to me and share it here. I have no intention of spoiling any books, or stomping on any copyrights.

## Why git, not a blog?

I am a developer at heart.  Git is amazing.  Markdown will due.  KISS,  Enough said.

## How I work

After over 25 years in technology I value work, though it may be misspelled, or incomplete it is more valuable in a git repo then it is on my laptop waiting for me to release it to the world.
With that in mind you will see lots of commits here. You may see some files that look like I am working on them. That is because I am.You will also notice I am committing all my work directly to TRUNK. This is deliberate and intentional.

## What I have read?

Check out the [books](./books/) folder in this repo for a full list.  Below are reading lists for a given subject.  Do not rely on these list, go explore the repo for your self.

### Dev Ops

DevOps is not a word, its not a T-shirt, it is not a buzz word. Though I am sure you may have
experienced all three of these versions of it.  

>"DevOps is more than just a fad or a new name for an old concept. Their work illustrates how DevOps
>can improve the state of the art in organizational design, software development culture, and systems architecture."
>â€”Baron Schwartz,

The books in this section are those I read to become a true DevOps practitioner.  I don't need a T-Shirt, LapTop sticker
or to use the buzz words. I just want a better way.

- [The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement](./books/the_goal.md)
- [The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](./books/the_phoenix_project.md)
- [The Unicorn Project: A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data](./books/the_unicorn_project.md)

- [This American Life Pod Cast #561 The NUMMI Story](./listen/nummi.md)

## Development

Books, Blogs and podcasts all developers should consume.  You will notice that lots of this thinking is OLD!
that is because great software development is not a new idea.

## Project Management

I dislike the term Project Management.  I prefer to manage the flow of work in a project. Picture a long road with traffic lights.  Do we speed to each light?  Go, Stop, Go Faster! Stop?  Have you ever passed a car on the freeway and think you are a super efficient driver only to take the exit and that same car is right behind you at the light?  Who is more efficient? Anyone can hurry. Hurry does not get work done, it causes stress.  Above all we want to get work done.

Managing flow, is doing the Correct thing at the Correct time while keeping the most important thing the most important thing.  Every amazing project manager I have ever worked with has managed flow, not urgency.  Sure they used urgency when it was called for.  It makes sense to speed up a bit to make the green light.  However, at all times they managed flow using Focus, Organization, Standards, and regulating speed which includes speeding up or urgency and even slowing some work down.  The point is not to pass the traffic light.  Its to hit all Green lights..  Every one.  Because "Any Efficiency before a constraint is a illusion of progress" ~Eliyahu M. Goldratt

Some say "We don't want or need Project management".  Well, much like architecture, even if you don't want it you will have it. you can intentionally add architecture to your software or you will end up with the architecture of your software.  You can intentionally manage your projects or your projects will manage you.

See these books.  You can choose any order you like, however I think this order will help you.

## Self

2021 I set a goal to read 12 books that make me a better human.  I met that goal and this repo is the result.  In 2022 I set my goal to read 9 books and again in 2023.  The focus in 2021 was to improve my self.  Some call these "Self Help" or "Management Books" or "Soft Skills Books" Sense reading these books was to make my self a better human I will just call them self focused.  If you are trying to work on you so you can help others this reading list may help.
