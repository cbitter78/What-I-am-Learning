## Notes

I listened to this audiobook twice.  I applied some of what I learned immediately, to surprising positive results.  I will be listening to more Tony Robbins.

### Concepts

To improve your life you must:

- Change your standards 
- Change your limiting beliefs
- Influenced yourself to take action 
- Influence others with integrity

#### Standards

If you do "good" you get "poor" results.  You must be Outstanding to get excellent results.  To be Outstanding you must Stand Out from the rest. 

Change your Standers.  Expect more from yourself than anyone else could possibly expect.  Then show up every day knowing this. 

> “I don’t compete with other people. I compete with what I am capable of” ~Michael Jordan

#### Beliefs

All believers carry consequences.
All human behavior is belief driven.
 
Belief is just being certain of something. You can change a belief by challenging the certainty that feeds it.  You can reinforce a good belief by adding to the certainty that feeds it.
 
What you perceive is what you believe.  Change the way you perceive things to shape and or change your beliefs.

#### Taking Action (Success Formula)

There are 5 steps:
 
1. Know your Outcome.  Really know it!  Visualize it.  Imagine it.
1. Know your Why.  Don't fall into the trap of doing something without knowing why. Make sure to read [Start with Why](../../books/start_with_why.md).
1. Take **MASSIVE** Action!  Don't just do something.  Take Massive action.
1. Pay attention (Sensory Acuity) and know if what you’re doing is working or not.
1. Change your approach if it’s not working.  Repeat this step until you get what you want.  Not until you are tired of it.  Until you get what you want.

##### Musts not Shoulds

We can only change when our Shoulds turn into Musts.  We tend to Should all over ourselves and tell ourselves that our Shoulds are Musts.  But they are not.

We should make our Musts before life decieds for us.

##### Changing

1. Change your Beliefs.  Believe that you can change.
1. Make it a Must!  Know you must change.  If you __should__ change you will not.
1. Know that you can change.  "I can make this change"  You are the person with the power to make this change.
1. Gain Leverage.  Most people don't change because they imagine to change is worse than the change itself.   
   - Associate that not changing will result in **massive immediate unbearable levels of pain**.
   - Associate changing will result in **massive immediate extraordinary levels of pleasure**.
1. Interrupt disabling patterns.  When you are doing something counter to the change, interrupt the pattern.  After the pattern is interrupted, create an empowering alternative. Replace the patterns with a positive one.  Then reinforce and reward it until it becomes habit.
1. Build Momentum.  Build on what is working. You can magnify this process using emotion.  Positive emotions speed you up and negative emotions slow you down.


#### Living in the past

The past does not equal the future. Just because you haven’t done it in the past doesn’t mean you can’t do it now. If you live in the past.  The past will become your future.
 
The [SEC Rule 156](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbrown/2016/09/29/past-performance-is-not-indicative-of-future-results/?sh=17db7d523bf5) requires mutual funds to tell investors "Past Performance Is Not Indicative Of Future Results".  We should learn from this.
 
The past should inform us.  We should learn from the past.  It is not an indicator of our future performance.  Your future is your responsibility!  No one else's. Your past is just that.  The past. 

#### Its not about discipline

When you must change then it's not about discipline.  Discipline helps but it is not the key.  Change your identity!  This is the difference between "I am trying to quit smoking" and "I am not a smoker". Change your identity to become outstanding!  Once you're there you never need to go back.  This same concept is in [Atomic Habbits](../../books/atomic_habits.md).

#### Sensory Acuity

I have always found it funny that once you buy a car you start seeing that car everywhere!  Turns out that's due to a small part of your brain.  The [Reticular Activating System](https://study.com/academy/lesson/reticular-activating-system-definition-function.html) (RAS) helps filter out noise and can help find patterns.  You can feed this system patterns you want to see and then use it to increase your Sensory acuity.  Or in other words.  It can help you pay attention.
 
I have read about RAS hacks in [Atomic Habits](../../books/atomic_habits.md).  In this book James Clear describes [Pointing and Calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_and_calling).
 
> "Sensory acuity is the measure of intelligence" 
 
When we find people who have high Sensory Acuity, we tend to describe them as "knowing their stuff" or "knowledgeable"  When you have more information about something because you pay Intentionally pay attention (Use all the RAS hacks) then you can make highly intelligent choices.

#### Six Human Needs 

- Certainty:  Just to operate you need a base level of certainty.
- Uncertainty: People need cetainty but at the same time need variety, surprise, adventure. When people have
  too much certainty people tend to get board. 

Certainty and Uncertainty forces in constent tension.

- Significance:  Meaning, importantannce being unique.
- Acceptance:  Connection, fitting in, being part of somthing, feeling loved.

People want to be Unique, important, Signifitant, Accepted, fit in and be part of the group.  Like Certainty and Uncertainty, Significance and Acceptance are also in tension.

- Grow:  If you don’t feel like you’re growing you’ll feel like you’re dying inside
- Contribute beyond yourself in a Meaningful way: 

Most people meet the first four needs. Howerver, the last two needs are key to success.  The cornerstone need is Groth.  If you are not growing then even if you are meeting the other needs, things tend to fall apart.

##### Become a team player

To contribute at an outstanding level you need to become a team player.  Because, people will do more for others they care about how they ever will for themselves.
 
You need to Connect when it’s not easy to connect.  Show appreciation in a Unique way.  Make sure to take care of yourself (the inner team) and Pick a team that will challenge you.


#### Rapport

There is someone out there that can help you do anything you want to do.  Why are they going to help you?  Rapport.  You need to learn to build Rapport.
 
Rapport is created by feeling of commonality.  When people have "something in common" then rapport can be built.  It is about paying attention and meeting people on the same level they are communicating so it’s easy for them.
 
You can create a feeling of commonality by:
 
1. Matching and mirroring
1. Mirroring eye contact.  If they hold eye contact, so should you.  If they dont then dont.
1. Match pitch and tone of voice
1. Match Proximity
1. Match touch patterns.
 
Don’t overdo it.  Pick one or two
 
When Rapport is created between two people who ever is most certainly will influence the other.

#### Learning and Teaching

> Learning is creating a relationship between Known and the UnKnown.

This is how I learn.  Find something I know and relate it to something I am learning.

When learning online and I don't grok, I have to take the time to find something that relates then build from there.

##### Teaching

If you are teaching and you try to build a relationship between a concept the learner does not know then they will not learn the new concept.  When you continue to do this you are a dumb teacher, you do not have a dumb learner.  It is the teacher's responsibility to consistency check with the learner and to find ways to relate concepts.

Tell stories, make analogies, make connections.

#### Values

Values are Emotional states that you believe are most important to feel or avoid.
 
If you’re positive and negative values are in conflict you can’t succeed.  For example if you value professional success but can't stand rejection then you have values that are in conflict.   If you value Safety and Adventure you have conflicting values.  If you value being healthy and eating donuts.  These will show up as self Sabotage.

#### Anchors

An anchor occurs when someone is in an Intense state (Fully associated). If at that time someone does anything unique and Anchor can be created.  You have experienced this when you hear a song and are taken back to a time and or place.  Or when you smell something and you have memories flooding back.  Or hear a voice and suddenly remember something sad.
 
Anchors can be super powers.  They can be bad and good.  You can Intentionally create positive anchors.  (Power anchors).  You can use them to cancel out bad anchors.  You can also use them to help you. 
 
Warning: When canceling an Anchor you need one much more powerful than the anchor you are canceling.  Or it can backfire.
