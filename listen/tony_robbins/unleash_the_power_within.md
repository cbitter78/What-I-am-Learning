  too much certainty people tend to get board.

- Significance:  Meaning, importantannce being unique.
- Acceptance:  Connection, fitting in, being part of somthing, feeling loved.

People want to be Unique, important and Signifitant and to be Accepted fit in and be part of the group.  Like 
Certainty and Uncertainty, Significance and Acceptance are also in tension.


- Grow:  If you don’t feel like you’re growing you’ll feel like you’re dying inside

The lack of growth is the key to keeping success without it. everything falls apart
