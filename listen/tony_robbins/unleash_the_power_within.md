## Notes


### Concepts

#### Creating Lasting Change




#### Musts not Shoulds

We can only change when our Shoulds turn into Musts.  We tend to Should all over ourselves and tell ourselves that our Shoulds are Musts.  But they are not.

We should make our Musts before life decieds for us.

#### Living in the past

The past does not equal the future. Just because you haven’t done it in the past doesn’t mean you can’t do it now. If you live in the past.  The past will become your future.
 
The [SEC Rule 156](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbrown/2016/09/29/past-performance-is-not-indicative-of-future-results/?sh=17db7d523bf5) requires mutual funds to tell investors "Past Performance Is Not Indicative Of Future Results".  We should learn from this.
 
The past should inform us.  We should learn from the past.  It is not an indicator of our future performance.  Your future is your responsibility!  No one else's. Your past is just that.  The past. 

#### Its not about discipline

When you must change then it's not about discipline.  Discipline helps but it is not the key.  Change your identity!  This is the difference between "I am trying to quit smoking" and "I am not a smoker". Change your identity to become outstanding!  Once you're there you never need to go back.  This same concept is in [Atomic Habbits](../../books/atomic_habits.md).

#### Sensory Acuity

I have always found it funny that once you buy a car you start seeing that car everywhere!  Turns out that's due to a small part of your brain.  The [Reticular Activating System](https://study.com/academy/lesson/reticular-activating-system-definition-function.html) (RAS) helps filter out noise and can help find patterns.  You can feed this system patterns you want to see and then use it to increase your Sensory acuity.  Or in other words.  It can help you pay attention.
 
I have read about RAS hacks in [Atomic Habits](../../books/atomic_habits.md).  In this book James Clear describes [Pointing and Calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_and_calling).
 
> "Sensory acuity is the measure of intelligence" 
 
When we find people who have high Sensory Acuity, we tend to describe them as "knowing their stuff" or "knowledgeable"  When you have more information about something because you pay Intentionally pay attention (Use all the RAS hacks) then you can make highly intelligent choices.

#### Six Human Needs 

- Certainty:  Just to operate you need a base level of certainty.
- Uncertainty: People need cetainty but at the same time need variety, surprise, adventure. When people have
  too much certainty people tend to get board. 

Certainty and Uncertainty forces in constent tension.

- Significance:  Meaning, importantannce being unique.
- Acceptance:  Connection, fitting in, being part of somthing, feeling loved.

People want to be Unique, important, Signifitant, Accepted, fit in and be part of the group.  Like Certainty and Uncertainty, Significance and Acceptance are also in tension.

- Grow:  If you don’t feel like you’re growing you’ll feel like you’re dying inside
- Contribute beyond yourself in a Meaningful way: 

Most people meet the first four needs. Howerver, the last two needs are key to success.  The cornerstone need is Groth.  If you are not growing then even if you are meeting the other needs, things tend to fall apart.

##### Become a team player

To contribute at an outstanding level you need to become a team player.  Because, people will do more for others they care about how they ever will for themselves.
 
You need to Connect when it’s not easy to connect.  Show appreciation in a Unique way.  Make sure to take care of yourself (the inner team) and Pick a team that will challenge you.


#### Rapport

There is someone out there that can help you do anything you want to do.  Why are they going to help you?  Rapport.  You need to learn to build Rapport.
 
Rapport is created by feeling of commonality.  When people have "something in common" then rapport can be built.  It is about paying attention and meeting people on the same level they are communicating so it’s easy for them.
 
You can create a feeling of commonality by:
 
1. Matching and mirroring
1. Mirroring eye contact.  If they hold eye contact, so should you.  If they dont then dont.
1. Match pitch and tone of voice
1. Match Proximity
1. Match touch patterns.
 
Don’t overdo it.  Pick one or two
 
When Rapport is created between two people who ever is most certainly will influence the other.
