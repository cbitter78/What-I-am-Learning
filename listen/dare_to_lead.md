A mentor of mine sent me this podcast.  It was so good I started bindging!  A few of my favorites are listed here.  I reccomend listening to them all.

## Leadership


## Trust

## Atomic Habits

This is a set of two epesoids on how to build habbits with [James Clear](http://jamesclear.com) about his book Atomic Habits.  Make sure to listen to [part 1](https://brenebrown.com/podcast/atomic-habits-part-1-of-2/) and then [part 2](https://brenebrown.com/podcast/atomic-habits-part-2-of-2/).  I love these quotes from James.

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems"
>
>"Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it is actually big. That's the paradox of making small improvements."
