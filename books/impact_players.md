## Notes

### Impact Players

#### Mindset

- Wear opportunity goggles.  Messy problems, unclear roles, unforeseen obstacles, moving targets, and unrelenting burdens are all opportunities not problems.
- Work from the assumption that a problem CAN BE solved.  Make No a squishy word with lots of wiggle room. "Jump into the fray and climb out with a solution."
- Do the job that’s needed.  Don't do your job.  Do the job that is needed.  If you dont know what that is.  Figure it out.
- Step up, then step back.  Step up and lead.  Then Step back and let others lead while you follow.
- Finish stronger.  Don't just finish.  Finish stronger.
- Ask and adjust.  Continually change your approach based on good, honest feedback.
- Make work light.  Create energy, and give energy.  Never be a drain.  Be awesome to work with. 
- Tap into the unwritten rules.  Read the rules, then pay attention to see what is really going on.
- Do things without being asked.  What things?  Look for the W.I.N (What's Important Now)
- Anticipating problems and having a plan.
- Have a service mindset with a strong sense of agency and a internal locus of control
- Empathize Upwardly.  Try to understand leadership, put yourself in their place and imagine what is important to and frustrates them.
- Job descriptions are starting points.  Go where you are needed.  Find what is important now and help there.  It does not matter if that matches your org chart or job description.
- Work with passion, not on their personal passion.  Bring all your energy and passion to your work.  Do not wait for your passion to bring you to work.
- Step Up, Then Step Back.  Look for things that need leadership.  The white noise, the problems that tend to just sit there and bug you.  Then Step up and fill the vacuum.  Invite yourself to the party by acting the part of a leader.  Then learn to pass the baton to others.  Make sure to Share your intent. Share the lead, make sure to intentionally create opportunities for others to lead. and Share the spotlight, make sure to find ways to spotlight the work of others.  Do all of this and keep leadership informed.  Check in often to ask and adjust to what is important now.
- Pick your battles.  You can not do all the things!  "When you choose your causes wisely, you will be viewed as a leader, not a rabble-rouser."
- Be Resilient.  Challenges are not problems.  They are nessessory and the way you learn.  Dig in and enjoy them.
- Be a low-maintenance and high-accountability person. Take ownership, anticipate problems and finish the whole job.
- Exceed expectations in delightful and surprising ways.  Do the whole job and then, do a little bit extra.  Be thoughtful here.
- Ask for help! Call in Reinforcements! Don't do things alone. When you ask for help you are creating opportunity for others and creating space for yourself.  "The most influential professionals can escalate an issue and ask for help while maintaining ownership of the solution."
- Negotiate what you need from the begining.  Make sure to aks for the help and support you need when you start.  If things change make sure to update this. "When we make a responsible request for help, it brings out the best in both parties."
- Expect problems!  They happen.  Problems are good, If you don't have problems you have a problem!  Imagine and visualize problems and their solutions before they happen.  "The surest way to overcome obstacles is to expect them from the start. By anticipating problems, we can finish strong, even in the worst of circumstances."
- Find a wingman.  "Increase your range of vision by enlisting a colleague to be your wingman. Ask them to monitor your weak spots and help you see problems on the horizon. Do the same for them."
- Finish Well.  Not only Finish Strong and exceed expectations but finish well.  Make sure to pace yourself so that after a brief rest you can get up and do it all again.
- Be aware of the cost of persisting or finishing at all costs.  Don't fall in love with a project.  Make sure to ask and adapt and be willing to let a project go.  Make sure what you are working on is What is Important Now.
- Vet with intent.  Don't just blow off steam.  Vent a little, but don’t release ownership of the problem.  Ask for support rather than sympathy.
- Be curious and open.  Never stop learning.  Know when you don't know then go find out.  It's ok to say I don't know.  "Impact Players were able to adapt because they were confident in their ability to learn. But they were also comfortable enough with themselves that the prospect of failure—an inherent risk of learning—didn’t compromise their self-worth. It is a posture of confidence—the belief that I have value that can grow and evolve."
- Have Confidence and humility.  Confidence you will overcome, humility that you don't yet know how.
- Be coachable and ask for guidance.  Many people say they want feedback, few know how to take feedback. Be the person who values feedback for the gift that it is and be coachable.
- Think before you act. Take a minute to reset so you can see clearly.
- Never overreact or overcorrect.  Much like driving a car on the highway you don't want to overcorrect.

> "If you want to become a leader, don’t wait for the fancy title or the corner office. You can begin to act, think, and communicate like a leader long before that promotion." ~Amy Gallo (Harvard Business Review)

> "The difference between winners and losers is how they handle losing . . . no one can completely avoid troubles and potential pitfalls are everywhere, so the real skill is the resilience to climb out of the hole and bounce back." ~Moss Kanter (Harvard Business Review)

> “no” is a squishy word, one that has a lot of wiggle room.

> You need a lot of relationship to do big things together.

> Earn them the right to change the rules.

> This is one of the central problems of modern organizations: if you are doing today’s job, you are probably handling yesterday’s priorities.

> Too many professionals are stuck in organizational boxes that don’t match the real work.

> As a general rule, if you aren’t working on your boss’s top three priorities, you are not working on the agenda.

> When leaders wield influence, not formal power, others follow by choice rather than obligation. Leaders need people to opt in.

> Impact Players are not just heroes; they are hero makers. They pull others into the spotlight and lead the team so that there are multiple winners and potential leaders.

> The truth is that when everyone’s in charge, no one is really in charge. Or, as I say at my house, when everyone is in charge of feeding the cats, the cats go hungry.

> When an organization has playmakers, it needs fewer formal managers.

> Willingness to lead without formal power creates a culture of courage, initiative, and agility.

> Impact Players don’t settle, and they don’t wait. They don’t necessarily right every wrong they encounter, but they look for ways to leave things better than they found them, without compulsion or even invitation.

> Elevating the contributions of others gets them the credit they deserve and engenders the trust you need to lead without authority.

> The real reward is not what we have accomplished by finishing but what we have become by persisting and what is now possible because we are stronger.

> When we reframe obstacles as challenges, we engage our mental faculties and become energized for the contest.

> Vent with intent. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to share your frustrations with your manager. And it’s healthy for managers to acknowledge the challenges their team members face. But there’s a proper way to whinge and moan: keep it infrequent, brief, and focused. If you need to let off some steam, vent a little, but don’t release ownership.

> When targets are continually moving, you need continual feedback, guidance, and correction so you can adjust your aim.

> Impact Players view changing conditions and moving targets as opportunities to learn, adapt, and grow.

> Being reactionary is often seen as a negative quality, but actually, Impact Players are reactors—responding to changes in their environment and the feedback they are given. By being reactive (but not reactionary), they adapt to a changing environment, much like a chameleon changes color to fit its surroundings.

> With a growth mindset, we see ourselves as capable of learning and changing. We interpret feedback as vital information we need to make adjustments. Challenges and obstacles serve as the training grounds for growth and feedback.

> “Reset walks.” When we reset, we find our right mind. We can’t change course until we can see clearly.
