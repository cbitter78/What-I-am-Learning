## Notes

### Impact Players

#### Mindset

- Wear opportunity goggles.  Messy problems, unclear roles, unforeseen obstacles, moving targets, and unrelenting burdens are all opertunites not problems.
- Do the job that’s needed.  Dont do your job.  Do the job that is needed.  If you dont know what that is.  Figure it out.
- Step up, then step back.  Step up and lead.  Then Step back and let others lead while you follow.
- Finish stronger.  Dont just finish.  Finish stronger.
- Ask and adjust.  Contiualy change your aproach based on good, hoest feedback.
- Make work light.  Create energy, and give energy.  Never be a drain.  Be awesome to work with.  
- Tap into the unwritten rules.  Read the rules, then pay attation to see what is really going on.
- Do things without being asked.  What things?  Look for the W.I.N (Whats Important Now)
- Anticipating problems and having a plan.
- Have a service mindset with a strong sense of agency and a internal locus of control
- Empathize Upward.  Try to understand leadership, put your self in their place and imagine what is important to and frustrates them.
- Job descriptions are starting points.  Go where you are needed.  Find what is important now and help there.  It does not matter if that matches your org chart or job description.
- Work with passion, not on their personal passion.  Bring all your energy and passion to your work.  Do not wait for your passion to bring you to work.
