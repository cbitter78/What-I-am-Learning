## Notes

This was a great book.  I highly recommend it.  I read this book not from the perspective of creating a great companies but more to create a great team.  There are some concepts that don't completely translate there but I felt it was well worth my time. I found it so helpful I plan to re-read this book at least a few more times.

### Concepts

Take some time and explore [Jims Concepts](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts.html).  Make sure to pay attention to the Map.

Level 5 Leaders.  My goal is to obtain level 5 leadership.

> “SMaC” is the essence of consistent tactical excellence. SMaC (pronounced “smack,” with a very hard “k” sound at the > end . . . SmmaacK!) stands for “Specific, Methodical, and Consistent.”
> …… 
> To be truly SMaC involves four basic elements:
> 1. Specific, replicable processes and mechanisms that create tremendous consistency
> 1. Checking and cross-checking systems to prevent catastrophic mistakes
> 1. Rigorous thinking to consider a wide range of contingencies and backups
> 1. Continuous evolution of SMaC based on understanding the why behind SMaC processes
> 
> This last element
> —understanding the why so that you can update and change the what is the crucial element that distinguishes an > advanced SMaC mindset from mere procedures and bureaucratic policies.

#### Stockdale Paradox

"You must maintain unwavering faith that you can and will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties, and at the same time, have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be"

#### Big Hairy Audacious Goal

[BHAG](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html) I first read about this concept in [Measure What Maters](measure_what_matters.md).  It is an amazing tool
