## Notes
 
I really enjoyed this book.  It provides a practical way to think about work.  Though I am a total fanboy of Kanban and Lean this book is not just about that.
I learned about why we want to make work visible and what it teaches us while I was learning how Kanban and Lean can help me.

### Concepts
 
As I read this book, I jotted down these steps as a way to increase output and reduce wait time.
 
1. Limit Work in Progress
1. Use all these great ideas to see why your not doing Step 1
1. See Step 1
1. Increase Flow by referring to Step 1
1. See Step 1 but this time be honest and get your priorities in line
1. See Step 1.  You can not do all the things at the same time. Try doing one thing well then repeat.
1. See Step 6,5,4,3,2, and 1
1. Did I say to see Step 1?  Yes!  Do that!

### What to measure
 
Read section 3.1 of the book.  Here are some of my notes.
 
1. Flow Time: This is a measure of how long something took to do from beginning to end.  This includes weekends, holidays, days off, whatever!
1. Lead Time: This is how long the work waits for a process
1. Cycle Time: This is the time a process takes.
1. Watch the work, not the people.
> Using pizza order and delivery as an example, the lead time clock starts ticking when the customer orders the pizza, while the cycle time clock doesn’t start ticking until the cook begins making the pizza. People who order pizza care about lead time. They want their pizza delivered quickly. Internal teams care about cycle time. They try to reduce the wait time in the delivery pipeline to be more efficient.

#### Breaks are not Interruptions or Distraction
 
Interruptions and Distractions require you to context switch.  Doing work with a plan and structure to rest and reflect increases output.  I am going to try the Pomodoro method.  I am also going to avoid being the cause of Interruptions or Distraction to others.

> Pomodoro: A time management method using a timer to break down work into time-boxed intervals separated by short breaks.1 Set a timer for twenty-five minutes and work on your task until the timer rings. When the timer rings, take a five-minute break. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (twenty to thirty minutes). Pomodoros give you permission to really focus.

> Distraction is one of the biggest hurdles to high-quality knowledge work, costing almost one trillion dollars annually.

#### Little’s Law
 
L = λW
 
Average cycle time for finishing tasks is calculated as the ratio between WIP (Work in Progress) and throughput.
See [Little’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law)
 
#### Hofstadter's Law
 
It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
 
See [Hofstadter's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law)

#### Kanban カンバン

I think most people know about, or rather think they know what Kanban is.  I suggest you learn about where it came from and how the Signal Card (Kanban) method was created and how it is used outside of Information Technology.  You may find it's much simpler than you think.
You may also find that it is extremely useful.  To get a better understanding you can read this book and [The Goal](./the_goal.md)

#### Kanban and Traffic?
 
What happens when you remove queues in favor of a flow or pull (Kanban) based system?  Well.  It works!
> "When Somerset County, England, changed their traffic system from lights to no lights, the townsfolk thought it wouldn’t work. “Drivers are not going to dovetail in,” they said. Surprisingly (to most citizens), after the traffic lights were removed, the queues instantly disappeared. It was less congested and easier for pedestrians to cross the street. A drive through town that used to take twenty minutes now took just five minutes. The difference was extraordinary. It took some time for people to adjust. Most people were used to just looking at the lights. Some drivers still assumed the right of way in the time-honored fashion dictated by traffic controls. Reform required a change in culture, and people had to unlearn their bad habits. It was a new way of thinking that required a mind shift, and it took a while for people to catch on, but it resulted in a system that was ultimately safer and faster. The same is true when moving to a Lean kanban flow approach. It’s new and different. People think it won’t work, and there is resistance across teams and departments."

### Quotes

> "Time is what we want most, but what we use worst." ~William Penn

> "Never let something important become urgent" ~Eliyahu Goldratt

> “Tell me how you measure me and I’ll tell you how I’ll behave” ~Eliyaju Goldratt

> "You don't learn to walk by following rules" You learn by doing and falling over. ~Richard Branson

> "Be approximately right rather than exactly wrong" ~John Tukey

> "Let the flow manage the processes, and not let managment mannage the flow" ~Taiichi Ohno

> Technologists who lack an understanding of the business context risk investing in initiatives that ultimately won’t drive value.

> Irrational perseverance (the failure to abandon a situation when available evidence suggests otherwise).

> We need diversity of thought and different ways of working. If we get caught up in the idea that there is a best practice—a perfect way of doing things—then we risk branding fresh perspectives or improvements as inherently flawed ideas.

> Parkinson’s Law: work expands to fill the time available for its completion. Let’s be honest—when was the last time you completed quality work days or even hours ahead of deadline?

> We can better manage what we can see.

> Multitasking is a good way to screw up progress,

> Multitasking is an effective way to get less done. It’s an effective way to give negligence free reign. When you try to do too many things at one time, you won’t do any of them great, and sometimes you won’t finish them at all.

> Busyness often means just doing so many things at once that they all turn out crappy.

> All it takes is a shift from haphazardly saying yes to everything to deliberately saying yes to only the most important thing at that time. And to do it visually.

> “A bad system will beat a good person every time.” ~Edwards Deming

> WIP is a leading indicator of cycle time. The more items that are worked on at the same time, the more doors open up that allow dependencies and interruptions to creep in.

> Every dependency increases the probability you will be late. If possible, reduce dependencies to save time and money and to avoid other complications. Conversely, every dependency you can find and eliminate doubles your chances of delivering on time.

> “Many things may be important, but only one can be the most important.” ~Ross Garber

> Frequency reduces difficulty.

> Busy people, however, do not signal productivity—delivered value does.

> Zombie projects are low-value projects that are barely alive. They lurk around looking for handouts, but they get no love. They are starving for money, resources, and people. Nevertheless, they persist, and in doing so, these starving projects subtly siphon people’s time and energy away from higher-value projects. When you discover a zombie project, kill it. Kill it so the more important work will be delivered sooner and with fewer interruptions.

> Not dealt with, important neglected work eventually becomes emergent.

> When we bring our visual sense to solving problems, we get clarity around the problem, and it’s easier to make decisions. Making work visible is one of the most fundamental things we can do to improve

> This is what we want to accomplish when we make our work visible: easy on the eyes, accurate, meaningful, and efficient at a glance.

> We do things for people we like—it’s one of the six reasons we take on more work than we have capacity to do.[...] The second reason is pretty basic: as team players, we don’t want to let our tribe down, and as mentioned before, we get endorphins from saying yes. The third reason is fear of public humiliation or of getting fired. The fourth is that we do stuff for people we like. The fifth reason relates to the fact that people are optimistic creatures, which leads us to think we can finish tasks faster than we actually do.

> Revenue protection work; namely, fixing technical debt and security work.

> By the time you find out you suck, you have sucked for a very long time.

> You are a rare bird if you are fortunate enough to have a wide-open calendar which allows you to schedule half your day (say four hours) on blah, blah and a quarter of your day (say two hours) on blah. Because much of the day is likely sliced up with meetings, email, and context switching between tasks, getting two hours of uninterrupted time to work on anything can be a luxury.

> Delayed important work becomes urgent, unplanned work.

> When the focus is on the metric instead of the goal, it’s a problem. If people don’t reveal things to us, then we lose transparency.

> Old school language tends to block progress.

> Think people (not resources), good practices (not best practices), and uncertainty (not exactness).
