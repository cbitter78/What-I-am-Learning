> "Growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts, your strategies, and help from others. Although people may differ in every which way—in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments—everyone can change and grow through application and experience." ~Carol Dweck

Your potential and intelligence is not fixed.  You can learn anything at any time. It is really up to you.

> "A few modern philosophers…assert that an individual’s intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism….With practice, training, and above all, method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgment and literally to become more intelligent than we were before." ~Alfred Binet, the inventor of the IQ test.

The story you tell yourself about your position and situation can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, which then reinforces that story. Use this to your advantage, and tell yourself the truth that you have the potential to grow. Then put in the work, and prove it.

> "The view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life." ~Carol Dweck


## Notes

There are 2 general mindsets,  Growth and Fixed.  The Growth mindset is one of the leading indicators to [impact players](./impact_players.md) and successful people. I want to intentionally
avoid fixed mindset behavior and replace it with growth. "If you don’t feel like you’re growing you’ll feel like you’re dying inside" ~Tony Robbins

You are never just one thing.  To improve or build a skill you work at it every day.  You can't just say I am going to do this growth mindset thing and
be done.  You have to work at it.  My method is to understand with behaviors and thinking look like for each mindset, then pay attention to the way
I am thinking and acting to see if I am in Growth or Fixed.   If I am displaying Fixed mindset behaviors I need to take action to adjust.

### Growth 



Actions, thoughts and behavors of Growth:

- Will I make a mistake and what will I learn from it that can make me better?
- I wonder what this situation has to teach me?
- I wonder why that happend? 
- What did I learn?
- I wonder why that person is acting like that?
- No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always change it quite a bit.
- You can always substantially change how intelligent you are.

### Fixed

Actions, thoughts and behavors of Fixed:

- Will I fail and how will that make me look?
- I cant believe this is happening to me!?
- I will never try that again
- They dont like me.
- It is not worth the effort to try
- Your intelligence is something very basic about you that you can’t change very much.
- You can learn new things, but you can’t really change how intelligent you are. 

## Quotes

> It’s not nature or nurture, genes or environment. From conception on, there’s a constant give-and-take between the two. In fact, as Gilbert Gottlieb, an eminent neuroscientist, put it, not only do genes and environment cooperate as we develop, but genes require input from the environment to work properly.

> Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.

> Mindsets change what people strive for and what they see as success. How they change the definition, significance, and impact of failure. And how they change the deepest meaning of effort.
