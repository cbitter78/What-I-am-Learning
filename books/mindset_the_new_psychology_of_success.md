> "Growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts, your strategies, and help from others. Although people may differ in every which way—in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments—everyone can change and grow through application and experience." ~Carol Dweck

Your potential and intelligence is not fixed.  You can learn anything at any time. It is really up to you.

> "A few modern philosophers…assert that an individual’s intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism….With practice, training, and above all, method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgment and literally to become more intelligent than we were before." ~Alfred Binet, the inventor of the IQ test.

The story you tell yourself about your position and situation can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, which then reinforces that story. Use this to your advantage, and tell yourself the truth that you have the potential to grow. Then put in the work, and prove it.

> "The view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life." ~Carol Dweck

Make sure you read the entire book.  The last 40% of this book is amazing!  You cant just skip there.  You have to read your way to it.


## Notes

There are 2 general mindsets,  Growth and Fixed.  The Growth mindset is one of the leading indicators to [impact players](./impact_players.md) and successful people. I want to intentionally
avoid fixed mindset behavior and replace it with growth. "If you don’t feel like you’re growing you’ll feel like you’re dying inside" ~Tony Robbins

You are never just one thing.  To improve or build a skill you work at it every day.  You can't just say I am going to do this growth mindset thing and
be done.  You have to work at it.  My method is to understand with behaviors and thinking look like for each mindset, then pay attention to the way
I am thinking and acting to see if I am in Growth or Fixed.   If I am displaying Fixed mindset behaviors I need to take action to adjust.

> Although for simplicity I’ve talked as though some people have a growth mindset and some people have a fixed mindset, in truth we’re all a mixture of the two. There’s no point denying it. Sometimes we’re in one mindset and sometimes we’re in the other. Our task then becomes to understand what triggers our fixed mindset. What are the events or situations that take us to a place where we feel our (or other people’s) abilities are fixed? What are the events or situations that take us to a place of judgment rather than to a place of development?

### Growth 

Actions, thoughts and behavors of Growth:

- Will I make a mistake and what will I learn from it that can make me better?
- I wonder what this situation has to teach me?
- I wonder why that happend? 
- What did I learn?
- I wonder why that person is acting like that?
- No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always change it quite a bit.
- You can always substantially change how intelligent you are.

> Even in the growth mindset, failure can be a painful experience. But it doesn’t define you. It’s a problem to be faced, dealt with, and learned from.


### Fixed

Actions, thoughts and behavors of Fixed:

- Will I fail and how will that make me look?
- I cant believe this is happening to me!?
- I will never try that again
- They dont like me.
- It is not worth the effort to try
- Your intelligence is something very basic about you that you can’t change very much.
- You can learn new things, but you can’t really change how intelligent you are. 
- It was never their fault.  In response to failure they Blame, Shrink or minimize the failure or Cheat to make it appear there is no failure.

> In the fixed mindset, however, the loss of one’s self to failure can be a permanent, haunting trauma.

> The idea of trying and still failing—of leaving yourself without excuses—is the worst fear within the fixed mindset,

> Many people with the fixed mindset think the world needs to change, not them. They feel entitled to something better—a better job, house, or spouse. The world should recognize their special qualities and treat them accordingly.

## The Danger Of Praise And Positive Labels

This section of the book is so important I felt it deserved a section in my notes.

The way we praise people, children in particular, is important.  Praising the effort and not inferring some innate endowed talent is important.

This: "You aced that test, you must study hard"
Not: "You are so smart no wonder you aced that test"

Focus on the effort, not the outcome. 

We also need to avoid labels like "Gifted and Talented"  WOW!  Labeling a subset of kids this way has all sorts of problems.  How about hard working and persistent? 



## Quotes

> It’s not nature or nurture, genes or environment. From conception on, there’s a constant give-and-take between the two. In fact, as Gilbert Gottlieb, an eminent neuroscientist, put it, not only do genes and environment cooperate as we develop, but genes require input from the environment to work properly.

> Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.

> Mindsets change what people strive for and what they see as success. How they change the definition, significance, and impact of failure. And how they change the deepest meaning of effort.

> John Wooden, the legendary basketball coach, says you aren’t a failure until you start to blame. What he means is that you can still be in the process of learning from your mistakes until you deny them.

> People with the fixed mindset tell us, “If you have to work at something, you must not be good at it.” They add, “Things come easily to people who are true geniuses.”

> Many growth-minded people didn’t even plan to go to the top. They got there as a result of doing what they love.

> “After forty years of intensive research on school learning in the United States as well as abroad, my major conclusion is: What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.” ~Benjamin Bloom,

> Growth mindset lets people—even those who are targets of negative labels—use and develop their minds fully. Their heads are not filled with limiting thoughts, a fragile sense of belonging, and a belief that other people can define them.

> Those with the growth mindset found success in doing their best, in learning and improving. And this is exactly what we find in the champions.

> Those with the growth mindset found setbacks motivating. They’re informative. They’re a wake-up call.

> Every word and action can send a message. It tells children—or students, or athletes—how to think about themselves. It can be a fixed-mindset message that says: You have permanent traits and I’m judging them. Or it can be a growth-mindset message that says: You are a developing person and I am committed to your development.

> Parents think they can hand children permanent confidence—like a gift—by praising their brains and talent. It doesn’t work, and in fact has the opposite effect. It makes children doubt themselves as soon as anything is hard or anything goes wrong. If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, seek new strategies, and keep on learning. That way, their children don’t have to be slaves of praise. They will have a lifelong way to build and repair their own confidence.

> Remember that praising children’s intelligence or talent, tempting as it is, sends a fixed-mindset message. It makes their confidence and motivation more fragile. Instead, try to focus on the processes they used—their strategies, effort, or choices.
