This was a fun book.  I find many of the principles in this book to cross over to other 
areas and skills.  Its a good book that taught me quite a bit. 

## Notes

### Principles

1. Perception: Stop Trying to Be a Great Public Speaker.  Be effective.
2. Perfection: When You Make a Mistake, No One Cares but You.
3. Visualization: If You Can See It, You Can Speak It
4. Discipline: Practice Makes Perfect Good.
5. Description: Make It Personal and Become a Storyteller
6. Inspiration: Speak to Serve.
7. Anticipation: Always Leave Your Audience Wanting More

Bonus Principle: Staying on Message:

### Donts

> Unless you have tested the material first, don’t make a joke or tell a funny story simply because you are nervous and trying to break the ice.You might break a lot more than just ice.

> Please don’t ever be a speaker who uses the phrase, “One last point,” or a variation of the line such as, “One last point and I’ll finish up,” or “I’m almost finished, but first I want to tell you about...”


### Quotes

> The best public speakers are those who seem to genuinely genuinely enjoy giving a speech. Because they’re relaxed, we’re relaxed. Great speakers speak to us, not at us, and the most effective public speaking is a relaxed and comfortable conversation between a speaker and his or her audience.

> Public speaking occurs any time you talk to anyone and someone else is present to hear you—intentionally or not.

> While one person hesitates because he feels inferior, the other is busy making mistakes and becoming superior.

> Know the material inside and out. Practice the material inside and out. Be able to give the speech without the benefits of having the written speech in front of you.

> “Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any one thing.” —Abraham Lincoln

> “Be sincere. Be brief. Be seated.” —Abraham Lincoln

> “The human brain starts working the moment you’re born and never stops until you stand up to speak in public.” —Anonymous

> “You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.” —Kahlil Gibran
