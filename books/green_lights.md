I think page 3 sums up .  
>This is not a traditional memoir. Yes, I tell stories from the past, but I have no interest in nostalgia, sentimentality, or the retirement most memoirs require. This is not an advice book, either. Although I like preachers, I’m not here to preach and tell you what to do. This is an approach book. I am here to share stories, insights, and philosophies that can be objectively understood, and if you choose, subjectively adopted, by either changing your reality, or changing how you see it. This is a playbook, based on adventures in my life. Adventures that have been significant, enlightening, and funny, sometimes because they were meant to be but mostly because they didn’t try to be. I’m an optimist by nature, and humor has been one of my great teachers. It has helped me deal with pain, loss, and lack of trust. I’m not perfect; no, I step in shit all the time and recognize it when I do. I’ve just learned how to scrape it off my boots and carry on.

## My thoughts

To me this book gave me a chance to step back and look at my life with a differnt perspective. I would not say I adopted an aproach but rather through Matthews lense I saw my life differntly. Then I used a few of his prescriptions and bumper stickers as they applied.

Super fun read.  I will read it again in a year just for fun.

## Notes

One in a Row!  "oneinarow Any success takes one in a row. Do one thing well, then another. Once, then once more. Over and over until the end, then it’s oneinarow again." This spoke to me.  We need to do one thing well. Just ONE! Then One More.

Negligence: "We must learn the consequences of negligence - it's not just what we do, it's what we don't do that's important as well. We are guilty by omission. I have seen over and over inaction cause more issues than any action.

> I never wrote things down to remember; I always wrote things down so I could forget.

>The arrival is inevitable: Death. A unanimous end, a unified destination. A noun without regard. Our eulogy. Written. Lived. The approach is relative: Life. A singular procession, our personal journey. A verb with regard. Our résumé. Write it. Live it.

>The sooner we become less impressed with our life, our accomplishments, our career, our relationships, the prospects in front of us—the sooner we become less impressed and more involved with these things—the sooner we get better at them. We must be more than just happy to be here.

>“Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.” Gore Vidal (1925- ) - 5-8-89 - “Isn’t that the fuckin’ truth. To have style you have to have those in this order. You’ve got to know who you are before you know what you want to say then not give a damn. But knowing who you are is the base that everything else comes from. I’ve got more style now than ever before but I’m still adding to my style. You know who you are when you become independent enough to believe your own thoughts and become responsible for your actions and you not only “believe” what you want but you live what you believe. LIVE WHAT YOU BELIEVE…“LIVE THE QUESTIONS FIRST, THEN WHAT YOU BELIEVE”...THEN YOU HAVE YOUR OWN PERSONAL STYLE”…..
