# The Helping Book

A good friend suggested this book to me when I was struggling in my parenting life.  It contains lots of great advice that can be applied in all aspects of your life.  After I read this book, I caught myself moving into "Doctor Mode" early or even unnecessarily.  Because of this awareness I was able to dial this tendency back and continue in humble inquiry longer to greater success.
