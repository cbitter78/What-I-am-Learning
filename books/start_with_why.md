# Start with Why

Before I read this book I approached efforts with **What** I will do and **How** I will do it. Until a friend nudged me to read this book, the idea that I need to start with **Why** just did not resonate. After all I am a do'er I have all these things that need doing.  Things are What and How!  Why do them at all? Thats a great question.

I really enjoyed this book.  Its obvious I was doing things backwards, to be fair I do most things backwards as a dyslexic person tends to.

## Notes

The Celery Test. Make sure to pay attion to this chapter. This was extreamly helpful to me ot understand how to colorbrate my why.

Its hard to explain Why when it Feels right.  Yes it is!

> “gut decisions” come from. They just feel right. There is no part of the stomach that controls decision-making, it all happens in the limbic brain. It’s not an accident that we use that word “feel” to explain those decisions either. The reason gut decisions feel right is because the part of the brain that controls them also controls our feelings. (Sinek, Simon. Start with Why (p. 57). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.)
