# My Reading List

Welcome. If you hare here you were probably were sent a link to this repository from me.  This repo holds the books I have read and a list of what I will be reading.

**This reop is **NOT** a source of "cliffs notes" you can read through to become yet
another **blog expert!**  If this is what you are after, go elsewhere.**

Explore and enjoy.

## How I read

I have grown up with the blessing of dyslexia.  Though this has aided me in some amazing ways I still struggle with reading.
I still sit down and read through quite a few paper books.  In this repo you may see reference to Audio books and Kindle books.
Most of the time I buy the Audio, Kindle and Paper Copy.  I listen to the Audio Book, Highlight and take notes in the Kindle app.
Then from time to time I will highlight the best parts in the paperback, add a note and give it away.
Maybe now that I have this repo I can just include a QR Code back to this repo?
