This book was reccomended to me by two friends. Both are closly related to Sam and DogFish.  It was a timely read as I find my self needing to move from a more indvidual contrubuotor mode to colorbration with sterigic planning. 

There are a few theams in this book.  

Use your powers for good

Its about time.  We only have so much

Love what you do.  Do what you love.

It is NOT about money.  You can not ignore money but it should not be your main driver.

Some structor enables creativity and freadom

Lean Start Up

Trust
