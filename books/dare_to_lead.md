Brené Brown has many books.  This was my first after listening to her [pod casts](../listen/berne_brown.md).  This is an awesome book on leadership.  If you are a leader which we can define as "Anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, and who has the courage to develop that potential.” then you should read this book.

Make sure to check out the pod casts I am addicted to [here](../listen/berne_brown.md)

## Notes

This is a dence book!  I had to take it a bit at a time.  So much content on every page.  I read it twice.


### Empathy vs Sympathy

This [Video short on Empathy vs Sympathy](https://brenebrown.com/videos/rsa-short-empathy/) is about 3 minutes and really helped me understand how to navagate Empathy.  Also review the Empathy skills and Empathy misses covered in the book in the Empathy section on page 136.

### Feeback Checklist

This [Check List](https://brenebrown.com/resources/the-engaged-feedback-checklist/) is super helpful for me when prepairing to give feedback.  Make sure to read the Living into Our Values and Feedback seciton in the book on page 198.

### Values

In the book under the Values section about page 200 or so Brené takes us through a process of identifying our core values.  I found that the [Values List](https://brenebrown.com/resources/dare-to-lead-list-of-values/) really helped me to find my 2 core values.  My core values are:

1. Kindness
2. Trust

These core values reinforced my secondary values, which are:

1. Accountabliity
2. Authenticity
3. Balance
4. Curage
5. Curiosity
6. Family
7. Honesty
8. Inclusion
9. Integrity
10. Leadership
11. Learning
12. Patience
13. Simplicity
14. Truth
15. Teaching
16. Vulnerability
