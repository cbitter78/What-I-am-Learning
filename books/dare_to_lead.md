Brené Brown has many books.  This was my first after listening to her [pod casts](../listen/berne_brown.md).  This is an awesome book on leadership.  If you are a leader which we can define as "Anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, and who has the courage to develop that potential.” then you should read this book.

Make sure to check out the pod casts I am addicted to [here](../listen/berne_brown.md)

## Notes

This is a dence book!  I had to take it a bit at a time.  So much content on every page.  I read it twice.

### Vulnerability

Lots of people say Brené's work is about Vulnerability.  I think it's important to understand what she means. She has lots to offer on this subject and you should read the book.  I will leave a few quotes here as reminders to myself.  Do not think this is a complete list, it's not.

> "Vulnerability is not winning or losing. It’s having the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome."

### Empathy vs Sympathy

This [Video short on Empathy vs Sympathy](https://brenebrown.com/videos/rsa-short-empathy/) is about 3 minutes and really helped me understand how to navagate Empathy.  Also review the Empathy skills and Empathy misses covered in the book in the Empathy section on page 136.

### Getting Feedback

Feedback is a gift.  However, do you accept gifts from just anyone?  A gift from someone you don't know or trust is most likely junk.

Who do you accept feedback from?

> "If you are not in the arena getting your ass kicked on occasion, I’m not interested in or open to your feedback."


### Giving Feedback

This [Check List](https://brenebrown.com/resources/the-engaged-feedback-checklist/) is super helpful for me when preparing to give feedback.  Make sure to read the Living into Our Values and Feedback section in the book on page 198.
Also keep in mind "We avoid tough conversations, including giving honest, productive feedback."   If giving the feedback is making you uncomfortable then
you know it needs to be done.   Do this with kindness. Remember "Clear is Kind"

### Values

In the book under the Values section about page 200 or so Brené takes us through a process of identifying our core values.  I found that the [Values List](https://brenebrown.com/resources/dare-to-lead-list-of-values/) really helped me to find my 2 core values.  My core values are:

1. Kindness
2. Trust

These core values reinforced my secondary values, which are:

1. Accountabliity
2. Authenticity
3. Balance
4. Curage
5. Curiosity
6. Family
7. Honesty
8. Inclusion
9. Integrity
10. Leadership
11. Learning
12. Patience
13. Simplicity
14. Truth
15. Teaching
16. Vulnerability

## Quotes

> "The courage to be vulnerable is not about winning or losing, it’s about the courage to show up when you can’t predict or control the outcome."

> "If you are not in the arena getting your ass kicked on occasion, I’m not interested in or open to your feedback."

> "Cruelty is cheap, easy, and chickenshit."

> "Vulnerability is not winning or losing. It’s having the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome."

> "Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind."

> "Choosing our own comfort over hard conversations is the epitome of privilege, and it corrodes trust and moves us away from meaningful and lasting change."

> "Cruelty is cheap, easy, and chickenshit."
