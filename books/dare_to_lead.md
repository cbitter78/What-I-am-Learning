Brené Brown has many books.  This was my first after listening to her [pod casts](../listen/berne_brown.md).  This is an awesome book on leadership.  If you are a leader which we can define as "Anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, and who has the courage to develop that potential.” then you should read this book.

Make sure to check out the pod casts I am addicted to [here](../listen/berne_brown.md)

## Notes

This is a dence book!  I had to take it a bit at a time.  So much content on every page.  I will have to re-read it a few times.
