Brené Brown has many books.  This was my first after listening to her [pod casts](../listen/berne_brown.md).  This is an awesome book on leadership.  If you are a leader which we can define as "Anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, and who has the courage to develop that potential.” then you should read this book.

Make sure to check out the pod casts I am addicted to [here](../listen/berne_brown.md)

## Notes

This is a dence book!  I had to take it a bit at a time.  So much content on every page.  I read it twice.

### Magical Thinking

This is when you think if you just keep doing something it will just work out, you have no idea why. Its Magical.  It can also show up when people do one action hoping it will have an unrelated result.  For example, "If I don’t tell them about this problem they will understand when it blows up in a few weeks".

I am always on the lookout for Magical Thinking in myself or others.  When I see this little gremlin poke its ugly head out, I start looking for a stealth intention and or a stealth expectation.  This has been extremely helpful to get to the root of the behavior. 

#### Stealth intention

I can protect myself from rejection, shame, judgment, and people turning away from me and thinking I’m a bad person. 

#### Stealth expectation

I completely relate with Brené when she wrote "Trust me when I tell you that stealth intentions and expectations are things, I have to wrestle with often in myself, sometimes on a daily basis."  I struggle with this every day.  Having language and an awareness has helped me improve.

### Vulnerability

Lots of people say Brené's work is about Vulnerability.  I think it's important to understand what she means. She has lots to offer on this subject and you should read the book.  I will leave a few quotes here as reminders to myself.  Do not think this is a complete list, it's not.

> "Vulnerability is not winning or losing. It’s having the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome."

> "There’s no faster way to piss off people than to try to manipulate them with vulnerability. Vulnerability is not a personal marketing tool. It’s not an oversharing strategy."

> "Vulnerability minus boundaries is not vulnerability. It’s confession, manipulation, desperation, or shock and awe, but it’s not vulnerability."

### The Rumble

> "A rumble is a discussion, conversation, or meeting defined by a commitment to lean into vulnerability, to stay curious and generous, to stick with the messy middle of problem identification and solving, to take a break and circle back when necessary, to be fearless in owning our parts, and, as psychologist Harriet Lerner teaches, to listen with the same passion with which we want to be heard."

#### Rumble Starters 
(from the book)

Here are some specific rumble starters and questions that we use: 
The story I make up…(This is by far one of the most powerful rumble tools in the free world. It’s changed every facet of my life. We’ll walk through it in the part “Learning to Rise.”) 
- I’m curious about… 
- Tell me more. 
- That’s not my experience (instead of “You’re wrong about her, him, - them, it, this…”). 
- I’m wondering… 
- Help me understand… 
- Walk me through… 
- We’re both dug in. 
- Tell me about your passion around this. 
- Tell me why this doesn’t fit/work for you. 
- I’m working from these assumptions—what about you?
- What problem are we trying to solve? Sometimes we’ll be an hour into a difficult rumble when someone will bravely say, “Wait. I’m confused. What problem are we trying to solve?” Ninety percent of the time we’ll realize that we’re not on the same page because we skipped the problem identification process and set a meeting intention of finding a solution to a problem that we had yet to define.


### Empathy vs Sympathy

> "Empathy is feeling with people. Sympathy is feeling for them. Empathy fuels connection. Sympathy drives disconnection."

> "I may not have had the exact same experience as you, but I know this struggle, and you are not alone."

> "Empathy is not connecting to an experience, it’s connecting to the emotions that underpin an experience. People often ask me how they can show empathy for someone who is going through something they’ve never experienced. Again, empathy is connecting to the feeling under the experience, not the experience itself. If you’ve ever felt grief, disappointment, shame, fear, loneliness, or anger, you’re qualified. Now you just need the courage to practice and build your empathy skills."

This [Video short on Empathy vs Sympathy](https://brenebrown.com/videos/rsa-short-empathy/) is about 3 minutes and really helped me understand how to navagate Empathy.  

People don’t want to be told how bad things are or worse that it will all be ok.  They want connection.  Empathy gives me a process to go With someone as they are going through a hard thing.  People don't like to be alone.  Being alone when during some of your hardest times can be scary and hard.  Knowing someone can just be there with you can be incredibly helpful. 

Review the Empathy skills and Empathy misses covered in the book in the Empathy section on page 136.  It is a must read!

### BRAVING

The below is directly from the book.  I put it here so I can come back often and remind myself of these values.

Boundaries: You respect my boundaries, and when you’re not clear about what’s okay and not okay, you ask. You’re willing to say no. 

Reliability: You do what you say you’ll do. At work, this means staying aware of your competencies and limitations so you don’t overpromise and are able to deliver on commitments and balance competing priorities. 

Accountability: You own your mistakes, apologize, and make amends. 

Vault: You don’t share information or experiences that are not yours to share. I need to know that my confidences are kept, and that you’re not sharing with me any information about other people that should be confidential. 

Integrity: You choose courage over comfort. You choose what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy. And you choose to practice your values rather than simply professing them. 

Nonjudgment: I can ask for what I need, and you can ask for what you need. We can talk about how we feel without judgment. We can ask each other for help without judgment. 

Generosity: You extend the most generous interpretation possible to the intentions, words, and actions of others.

### Getting Feedback

Feedback is a gift.  However, do you accept gifts from just anyone?  A gift from someone you don't know or trust is most likely junk.

Who do you accept feedback from?

> "If you are not in the arena getting your ass kicked on occasion, I’m not interested in or open to your feedback."

> "Don’t grab hurtful comments and pull them close to you by rereading them and ruminating on them. Don’t play with them by rehearsing your badass comeback. And whatever you do, don’t pull hatefulness close to your heart. Let what’s unproductive and hurtful drop at the feet of your unarmored self. And no matter how much your self-doubt wants to scoop up the criticism and snuggle with the negativity so it can confirm its worst fears, or how eager the shame gremlins are to use the hurt to fortify your armor, take a deep breath and find the strength to leave what’s mean-spirited on the ground. You don’t even need to stomp it or kick it away. Cruelty is cheap, easy, and chickenshit. It doesn’t deserve your energy or engagement. Just step over the comments and keep daring, always remembering that armor is too heavy a price to pay to engage with cheap-seat feedback."


### Giving Feedback

I have to tell myself that giving feedback is hard.  It should be uncomfortable.  Lean into the discomfort and work through it.  >

> "Choosing our own comfort over hard conversations is the epitome of privilege, and it corrodes trust and moves us away from meaningful and lasting change."

This [Check List](https://brenebrown.com/resources/the-engaged-feedback-checklist/) is super helpful for me when preparing to give feedback.  Make sure to read the Living into Our Values and Feedback section in the book on page 198.
Also keep in mind "We avoid tough conversations, including giving honest, productive feedback."   If giving the feedback is making you uncomfortable then
you know it needs to be done.   Do this with kindness. Remember "Clear is Kind"

### Values

In the book under the Values section about page 200 or so Brené takes us through a process of identifying our core values.  I found that the [Values List](https://brenebrown.com/resources/dare-to-lead-list-of-values/) really helped me to find my 2 core values.  My core values are:

1. Kindness
2. Trust

These core values reinforced my secondary values, which are:

1. Accountabliity
2. Authenticity
3. Balance
4. Curage
5. Curiosity
6. Family
7. Honesty
8. Inclusion
9. Integrity
10. Leadership
11. Learning
12. Patience
13. Simplicity
14. Truth
15. Teaching
16. Vulnerability


## Quotes

> "The courage to be vulnerable is not about winning or losing, it’s about the courage to show up when you can’t predict or control the outcome."

> "If you are not in the arena getting your ass kicked on occasion, I’m not interested in or open to your feedback."

> "There are a million cheap seats in the world today filled with people who will never be brave with their lives but who will spend every ounce of energy they have hurling advice and judgment at those who dare greatly. Their only contributions are criticism, cynicism, and fearmongering. If you’re criticizing from a place where you’re not also putting yourself on the line, I’m not interested in what you have to say."

> "Vulnerability is not winning or losing. It’s having the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome."

> "Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind."

> "Cruelty is cheap, easy, and chickenshit."

> "When something goes wrong, individuals and teams are rushing into ineffective or unsustainable solutions rather than staying with problem identification and solving. When we fix the wrong thing for the wrong reason, the same problems continue to surface. It’s costly and demoralizing."

> "Rather than spending a reasonable amount of time proactively acknowledging and addressing the fears and feelings that show up during change and upheaval, we spend an unreasonable amount of time managing problematic behaviors."

> "Courage and fear are not mutually exclusive. Most of us feel brave and afraid at the exact same time."

> "Our ability to be daring leaders will never be greater than our capacity for vulnerability."

> "Easy learning doesn’t build strong skills."

> "Daring leaders must care for and be connected to the people they lead."

> "People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care."

> "There’s a saying from the Asaro tribe in Papua New Guinea that I love: “Knowledge is only rumor until it lives in the bones.” The only way I know to get knowledge into our bones is to practice it, screw it up, learn more, repeat."

> "I don’t trust people who don’t love themselves and tell me, ‘I love you.’ There is an African saying which is: Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt."
