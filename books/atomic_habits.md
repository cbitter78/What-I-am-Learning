### Concepts

#### Systems not Goals

It's not about Goals. "If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead." and "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

Goals are good, but they just inform how you should design the system to achieve the outcome. A system is made up of many moving parts to achieve an outcome. To reach a goal you need to engineer a system that will produce the outcome. Just setting a goal will not get you there.

> "The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress."

#### Identity

As my dad used to say, "You are what you think" When you see yourself as a person that does X or Y you then support that habit. Identity is a collection of the behaviors your exabit. If you want to change your behaviors, or habits then change your identity then the behaviors will follow.

> "The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this."

### Quotes

> You get what you repeat.

> Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits.

> If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses,

> Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

> The most powerful outcomes are delayed.

> When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.

> Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.

> Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.

> The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.

> True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.

> You get what you repeat. If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses,

> Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

> Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

> If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

> Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.

> One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.

> We’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.

> Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.

> “It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.” ~Antonio Damasio

> We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.

> When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome.

> When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something.

> Both common sense and scientific evidence agree: repetition is a form of change.

> Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work

> Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.

> Prime your environment to make future actions easier.

> The point is to master the habit of showing up.

> You have to standardize before you can optimize.

> As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.*

> The last mile is always the least crowded.

> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” ~Charles Goodhart

> Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or soft.

> "Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail." ~LAO TZU
