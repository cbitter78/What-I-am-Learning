## Notes

In the Goldratt tradition, this book is instruction manuel disguised as a novel.  It brings together the ideas and concepts introduced in The Goal, Critical Chain, Beyond the Goal and other books based on Goldratts work into a framework you can use to manage the flow of work.  Or what we might call a project.

This book introduces the [Rules of Flow](#rules-of-flow).  Combine these the riles in The Goal, Critical Chain, and Beyond the Goal.  For example the 4th rule of flow. How do you do that?  See Critical Chain for Buffer and Gate management.  

### Rules of Flow

1. ​Avoid bad multitasking, control your WIP (Work in Process)
1. ​If you don’t want to get stuck, verify full-kit before you get going
1. ​Triage to ensure you are working on the right priorities
1. ​Ensure synchronization between your tasks/people/ resources
1. ​If you keep going back to the same projects and you don’t get the desired results, look into the option to increase the dosage
1. ​Avoid unnecessary rework by finding what causes it
1. ​Standardization is recommended when improvising is costly
1. ​Abolish local optimum, global optimum is what matters
