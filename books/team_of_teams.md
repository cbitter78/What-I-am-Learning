This is not a substitute for reading this book but it gives you a good idea of what you can expect in this book.

## Notes

When I started this book, I was not sure how fighting al qaeda in Iraq would teach me about technology and leadership. I was surprised as I continued to read this book. This book is about finding a way to work in a Complex world. Complex systems are everywhere and are increasing at breakneck speed. I found this book to be an excellent story on how others have found ways to deal with this unique environment and still retain the useful lessons and practices that we have learned in the past when dealing with I complicated systems.

I read this book twice.  I will make it a point to re-read this one once a year.

### Concepts

#### Brook’s Law

The adage that adding staff to speed up a behind-schedule project “has no better chance of working . . . than would a scheme to produce a baby quickly by assigning nine women to be pregnant for one month each . . . adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."

#### The Perry Principal

> "When they can see what’s going on, leaders understandably want to control what’s going on. Empowerment tends to be a tool of last resort. We can call this tethering of visibility to control the “Perry Principle.”


### Stories

#### Horatio Nelson and the Battle of Trafalgar

On October 21, 1805. Admiral Nelson faced off with the Franco-Spanish fleet.  He had 27 ships vs 33 ships. If he were to fail then England would fall.  He was outnumbered and outgunned.  Though he did not have more
resources he had a team.  A team of captains where "Every captain was a Nelson".  He built a culture of empowerment and communication.  This was unorthodox at the time when most navy Admirals would oristrate the battle by signaling to their captains every move in the battle.  No captain was to act without orders from the commander.
 
Nelson knew this was not effective.  Commands were sent from ship to ship with flags and other signals.  Orders were lost and misunderstood in battle due to smoke and other conditions.   Nelson knew he could not command the battle.  Instead he gave his captains a complete understanding of the goal and empowered them.  “No captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy.”  He did not withhold information, rather he shared it.  Every captain knew the global context and what the desired outcome was.  He ensured that individual commanders should act on their own initiative once the mêlée had developed.  He allowed and, indeed, expected his subordinates to use their own initiative, at the same time reducing the fleet’s dependence on uncertain methods of communication” such as signaling.  This was called “the Nelson touch”.
 
Nelson's forces prevailed.  19 of the French ships were captured.  Nelson did not lose a single ship.  Nelson was fatally shot about an hour into the battle.  He was below decks and died shortly after he heard word that they had won the battle.  His team achieved the goal without him commanding them.  He led them, prepared them, then they executed!

> At its heart, Nelson crafted an organizational culture that rewarded individual initiative and critical thinking, as opposed to simple execution of commands.

### Quotes

> Innovation and problem solving become the products of teamwork, not a single architect.

> We’re not lazier or less intelligent than our parents or grandparents, but what worked for them simply won’t do the trick for us now.

> Efficiency remains important, but the ability to adapt to complexity and continual change has become an imperative.

> Efficiency, once the sole icon on the hill, must make room for adaptability in structures, processes, and mind-sets that is often uncomfortable.

> The constantly changing, entirely unforgiving environment in which we all now operate denies the satisfaction of any permanent fix.

> An organization must be constantly led or, if necessary, pushed uphill toward what it must be. Stop pushing and it doesn’t continue, or even rest in place; it rolls backward.

> Feeling comfortable or dodging criticism should not be our measure of success.

> Adaptability, not efficiency, must become our central competency.


> “Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right thing.” ~Peeter F Ducker

> “robust-yet-fragile” ~Andrew Zolli and Ann Marie Healy

> "This scientific method requires of its practitioners high standards of
personal honesty, open-mindedness, focused vision, and love of the truth. These
are solid virtues, but science has no exclusive lien on them. The poet has these
virtues also, and often turns them to higher uses." ~Warren Weaver, Science And Complexity
