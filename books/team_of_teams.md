## Notes

When I started this book, I was not sure how fighting al qaeda in Iraq would teach me about technology and leadership. I was surprised as I continued to read this book. This book is about finding a way to work in a Complex world. Complex systems are everywhere and are increasing at breakneck speed. I found this book to be an excellent story on how others have found ways to deal with this unique environment and still retain the useful lessons and practices that we have learned in the past when dealing with I complicated systems.

I will make it a point to re-read this one once a year.

### Concepts

#### Brook’s Law

The adage that adding staff to speed up a behind-schedule project “has no better chance of working . . . than would a scheme to produce a baby quickly by assigning nine women to be pregnant for one month each . . . adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."
