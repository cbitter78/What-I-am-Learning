# The Unicorn Project

This is the second in a series of DevOps books frmm [Gene Kim](https://www.amazon.com/Gene-Kim/e/B00AERCJ9E?ref=dbs_t_r_fta_b00aercj9e).
The first is [T]he Phonenix Project](the_phonenix_project.md) which is set in a company, Parts Unlimited. 
This book continutes the Parts Unlimited story in a differnt and updated fashon.  Though in the preface it says that
reading The Phonenix Project is not required I think its worth doing.

Both of these books are roughly based on [The Goal](the_goal.md) which is also a greate read.

## My thoughts

Once again it seems that Gene has total visability into where I work.   I see these patterns over and over.
This means that we in IT are not special.  We produce product.  We suffer from the same mistakes over and over.
By understanding these problems we can avoid them


## Quotes

> when engineers think of “the customer” in the abstract instead of as a real person, you rarely get the right outcomes.
