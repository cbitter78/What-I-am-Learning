# The Unicorn Project

This is the second in a series of DevOps books from [Gene Kim](https://www.amazon.com/Gene-Kim/e/B00AERCJ9E?ref=dbs_t_r_fta_b00aercj9e).
The first is [The Phoenix Project](the_phonenix_project.md) which is set in a company, Parts Unlimited.
This book continues the Parts Unlimited story in a different and updated fashion.  Though in the preface it says that
reading The Phoenix Project is not required I think its worth doing.

Both of these books are roughly based on [The Goal](the_goal.md) which is also a grate read.

## My thoughts

Once again it seems that Gene has total visibility into where I work.   I see these patterns over and over.
This means that we in IT are not special.  We produce product.  We suffer from the same mistakes over and over.
By understanding these problems we can avoid them

If you want a good interview with Gene watch [Gene Kim Author of The Unicorn Project on DevOps and Business Innovation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__7d3rnPNqY).

## Quotes

> agility is never free.

> when engineers think of “the customer” in the abstract instead of as a real person, you rarely get the right outcomes.

> A healthy software system is one that you can change at the speed you need, where people can contribute easily, without jumping through hoops. This is how you make a project that’s fun and worthwhile contributing to, and where you often find the most vibrant communities.

> As the project owner, she sees it as her primary responsibility to ensure that any contributor can be productive.

> The joy of teaching people something that they want to learn is awesome.

> I’ll scream at the next one who wants me to write a Product Requirements Document....  you can prototype most features in the time it takes to even write one page of a PRD.
 
> “The Fourth Ideal asserts that we need psychological safety, where it is safe for anyone to talk about problems. Researchers at Google spent years on Project Oxygen and found that psychological safety was one of the most important factors of great teams: where there was confidence that the team would not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up. “When something goes wrong, we ask ‘what caused the problem,’ not ‘who.’ We commit to doing what it takes to make tomorrow better than today.

> Almost everything I need to do, I have to go up two levels, over two levels, and down two levels just to talk with a fellow engineer!” “The Square!”

> when everyone merges their changes frequently to the ‘master branch,’ such as once per day. That way, the size of the changes being merged are never allowed to get too large. Small batch sizes, like in manufacturing, create a smooth flow of work, with no jarring disruptions or catastrophes.

> “A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders zero beers. Orders 999,999,999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders negative one beer. Orders a ‘sfdeljknesv.’”

> ‘a bad system will beat a good person every time.’

> “The famous Andon cord is just one of their many tools that enable learning. When anyone encounters a problem, everyone is expected to ask for help at any time, even if it means stopping the entire assembly line. And they are thanked for doing so, because it is an opportunity to improve daily work. “And thus problems are quickly seen, swarmed, and solved, and then those learnings are spread far and wide, so all may benefit,” he says. “This is what enables innovation, excellence, and out learning the competition.

> “Innovation and learning occur at the edges, not the core. Problems must be solved on the front-lines, where daily work is performed by the world’s foremost experts who confront those problems most often.

> It’s about excellence, the ruthless pursuit of perfection, the urgency to achieve the mission, a constant dissatisfaction with the status quo, and a zeal for helping those the organization serves.
