> We are on the cusp of a transition to a stable state of software development where we have learned to blend agility and discipline. Our processes will use the quick feedback loops popularized by Agile and will guide us to design techniques that drive quality.

> Designing an architecture will help you discover the challenging (and interesting) parts of the problem that might cause big trouble later.

## Notes

All software needs Architecture.  Not all software needs someone with the title. 

> Being a software architect also implies a person who thinks about software design in a certain way. No matter what the title on your business card reads... You don’t need permission to inject architectural thinking into your team’s design discussions.

> Always remember, software architect is a way of thinking, not just a role on the team. When you’re wearing your programmer hat, you’ll make dozens of design decisions daily. Some of these decisions have architectural significance. Anyone who makes a decision that influences the structures of the software system becomes the architect pro tempore.






### Software Architecture

> A system’s software architecture is the set of significant design decisions about how the software is organized to promote desired quality attributes and other properties.

Significant Design Decision?

- Costly to change later
- Point of no return
- Influence quality attributes
- Affect the schedule
- Affects many people or forces other software systems to change

#### Quality Attributes

 These are sometimes named architecture characteristics, or "ilities" after the suffix many of the words share.    They are a subset of [Non-functional requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement).  In most cases Quality Attributes used to measure a system.   Such as reliability, testability, observability, etc..  This is a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes).

> A quality attribute is any externally visible characteristic by which stakeholders judge a software system’s goodness. Some examples include scalability, availability, maintainability, and testability. You experience quality attributes when you interact with the software.

They are usually [architecturally significant requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecturally_significant_requirements)


## Quotes

> How you arrive at an answer—the journey—is as important as the solution itself.

> Software systems are never partitioned perfectly. You’ll make compromises.

> All software has technical debt. Technical debt is an inevitable byproduct of success. The best software development teams use technical debt strategically to ship faster

> Architecture design is a social activity. Skills development is crucial to your team’s success.

> Precision in language is important. Using a term with specific meaning to describe something general can create confusion.

> Focusing on the people affected by your design decisions helps you concentrate on the exact problems that must be solved. It also grounds your solution exploration by reminding you that your purpose is to build software that helps people.


> One of the least effective ways to design software architecture is to ignore the software systems that came before us.

> There are many ways to make architecture tangible. Draw it. Make it come alive in the code you write. Build prototypes that let people experience structures and quality attributes. Create simple models that show how some part of the architecture works. Create relatable metaphors. Act out parts of the control flow of the system.




> A minimalist architecture only shows how high-priority quality attributes are achieved and reduces risks for promoting those quality attributes. All other design decisions are left open for downstream designers to determine.
