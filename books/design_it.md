## Notes

### Software Architecture

> A system’s software architecture is the set of significant design decisions about how the software is organized to promote desired quality attributes and other properties.

Significant Design Decision?

- Costly to change later
- Point of no return
- Influence quality attributes
- Affect the schedule
- Affects many people or forces other software systems to change







## Quotes

> How you arrive at an answer—the journey—is as important as the solution itself.

> Software systems are never partitioned perfectly. You’ll make compromises.

> All software has technical debt. Technical debt is an inevitable byproduct of success. The best software development teams use technical debt strategically to ship faster

> Architecture design is a social activity. Skills development is crucial to your team’s success.

> Precision in language is important. Using a term with specific meaning to describe something general can create confusion.
