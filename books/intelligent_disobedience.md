# Intelligent Disobedience

If you are a human, you should read this book.

Do Right When What You're Told to Do Is Wrong. This is obvious right? This book was an excellent exploration into this question. What really stood out to me was that most of us believe we will do the right thing all the time. We see that is not really the case. Its a skill and like all skills we must practice.  its not enough refuse the wrong thing but having the wherewithall to understand how to avoid a course of action in a really smart way.  This is the Intelligenance.

I found my self thinking these skills are vital for me and for me to teach to my children.
