# Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard

I enjoyed this book. It gave me lots to think about when trying to effect change both on a small scale, like with myself or my family or with a team at work.  I think the framework it teaches is not foolproof but it does provide a general pattern on how to effect change.

If you are trying to effect a change I suggest this book.
