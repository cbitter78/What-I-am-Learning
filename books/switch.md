I enjoyed this book. It gave me lots to think about when trying to effect change both on a small scale.  I think the framework it teaches is not foolproof but it does provide a general pattern on how to effect change.
If you are trying to effect a change I suggest this book.

Give these videos a watch to get an overview of the book.  You still need to read the book. ;)

## Notes

Change can be like an Elephant it's hard to get them to move, and to move in the direction you want.  You want to:

1. Direct the rider
1. Motivate the Elephant
1. Shape the path.

Keep in mind. Large change is hard.  Shrink the change, keep it simple. Build on small simple things to effect large change.
