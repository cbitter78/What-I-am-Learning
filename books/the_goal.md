This book was first published in 1983.   It describes how to solve for flow and constraints.   The [Phoenix Project](./the_phoenix_project.md) Is based on this book.  If you are in IT, Write Software or want to learn about DevOps (the real DevOps that makes people money) then read this book.

One note.  This book was released in Japan in the early 2000's  In just a few months it sold 3 million copies.  Toyota put it on the MUST read list for all employees.  Why did it take so long to be released in Japan? (about 18 years).   Because this book is so useful the author Eliyahu M. Goldratt feared that if he released it back in the 80s that japan would shift the world economy so much that the US would be plunged into a depression.   Given the improvements made in Japan after the books release some might say his fears were founded.
