> Being decisive is itself a choice. Decisiveness is a way of behaving, not an inherited trait. It allows us to make brave and confident choices, not because we know we’ll be right but because it’s better to try and fail than to delay and regret. Our decisions will never be perfect, but they can be better. Bolder. Wiser. The right process can steer us toward the right choice. And the right choice, at the right moment, can make all the difference.

## Notes

### Four Villains of Decision Making

Be on the lookout for these villains.

- First: Narrow Framing, which is the tendency to define our choices too narrowly.
    Look for:
    - Whether **or** not
    - Sham options
    Defend with:
    - [Widen Your Options](#widen-your-options)
- Second: Confirmation Bias, Our normal habit in life is to develop a quick belief about a situation and then seek out information that bolsters our belief
- Third: Short-Term Emotion, We can get caught up in the History, Feelings or how we feel at the time
- Forth: overconfidence, When we are overconfident we tend to be wrong. 
    > The odds of a meltdown are one in 10,000 years. —Vitali Sklyarov, minister of power and electrification in the Ukraine, two months before the Chernobyl accident
    
    > Who the hell wants to hear actors talk? —Harry Warner, Warner Bros. Studios, 1927
    
    > What use could this company make of an electrical toy? —William Orton, president of the Western Union Telegraph Company, in 1876, rejecting an opportunity to purchase Alexander Graham Bell’s patent on the telephone

    > We have too much confidence in our own predictions. When we make guesses about the future, we shine our spotlights on information that’s close at hand, and then we draw conclusions from that information.

> - You encounter a choice. But narrow framing makes you miss options.
> - You analyze your options. But the confirmation bias leads you to gather self-serving information.
> - You make a choice. But short-term emotion will often tempt you to make the wrong one.
> - Then you live with it. But you’ll often be overconfident about how the future will unfold.

### Moral Algebra

> In 1772, Benjamin Franklin was asked for advice by a colleague who’d been offered an unusual job opportunity. Franklin replied in a letter that, given his lack of knowledge of the situation, he couldn’t offer advice on whether or not to take the job. But he did suggest a process the colleague could use to make his own decision. Franklin said that his approach was “to divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns, writing over the one Pro and over the other Con.” During the next three or four days, Franklin said, he’d add factors to the two columns as they occurred to him. Then, he said: When I have thus got them all together in one view, I endeavour to estimate their respective weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a reason Pro equal to some two reasons Con, I strike out the three. If I judge some two reasons Con equal to some three reasons Pro, I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the balance lies; and if after a day or two of farther consideration nothing new that is of importance occurs on either side, I come to a determination accordingly.

Be warned.  Our biases gets in the way.  The second villain shows up here all the time.

> Research in psychology over the last 40 years has identified a set of biases in our thinking that **doom the pros-and-cons model of decision making**. If we aspire to make better choices, then we must learn how these biases work and how to fight them (with something more potent than a list of pros and cons).

### Mindsets

- Prevention: Avoiding negative outcomes.
- Promotion: Pursuing positive outcomes.

Toggle between the prevention and promotion mindsets.  And not Or.

### WRAP process

- **W**iden Your Options
- **R**eality-Test Your Assumptions
- **A**ttain Distance Before Deciding
- **P**repare to Be Wrong

In no particular order.  

#### Widen Your Options

- And not Or
- Multi-Track.  Consider multiple options at the same time.  Not linearly.  Not too many.  Avoid the choice paradox. Less than 5 is a good rule of thumb.
- Expand your real options
- State Opportunity Costs "Do you want the 1000.00 stereo or the 700.00 one and 300.00 in new music?".  Say it out loud.
- Vanishing Options Test.  "Vanishing Options Test, which you can adapt to your situation: You cannot choose any of the current options you’re considering. What else could you do?"
- Take an outside perspective
- Look to see how the problem has already been solved.  Ladder Up.  Look for local analogies, then regional analogies.  Don't go to far up the Ladder.
- Use or create playlist that help you expand your focus.

#### Reality-Test Your Assumptions

- Consider the opposite.  This shows up as being curious. Some say its the rule of assuming positive intent.  I think it can show up in many different ways.  An example is the Vanishing Options Test.
- Make a deliberate mistake.  Take what you think you know to be true and test it.  If you think if you don't do X or Y will happen.  Do a little X and see if Y really happens.   Test your assumptions.  I hear that "These are not assumptions they are facts". ok.. Step back, be honest and ask your self how do you know?  Has the context changed?  If they are facts then I can test them?
- Decentring views.  Be "Disagreeable" I mean, make it easy for people to disagree with you.  The outcome of this is to find information you would not discover in agreement.

    > CEO and chairman of General Motors, once interrupted a committee meeting with a question: “Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete agreement on the decision here?” All the committee members nodded. “Then,” Sloan said, “I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what this decision is about.”

    - What would have to be true? Test.  For the thing you don't what, what would have to be true for us to want it?
    - In stall tripwires.  If X happens then what?  or When Y happens we should re-visit this?

- Ask detailed questions that provoke thought.  A playlist is useful here.  Be careful where there is a power dynamic.  In that case you will want to ask open ended questions.  A question is not a hammer or a single tool.  Learn to ask the right question at the right time.
    > Asking tough, dis-confirming questions like these can dramatically improve the quality of information we collect

    > How do you know whether to ask probing questions or open-ended ones? A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself, “What’s the most likely way I could fail to get the right information in this situation?” Generally, it will be obvious what the answer is: If you’re buying a used car, you’re most likely to fail by not discovering a flaw of the vehicle, or if you’re a vice president seeking feedback from factory workers, you’re most likely to fail by not uncovering what they really think. You can tailor your questions accordingly—more aggressive in the used-car negotiations and more open-ended with the factory worker.

    Be on the look out for weak, confirming questions.  "Is the [insert dish on any restaurant menu] good?"  This is a weak confirming question.  What do you think the server will say?  Instead, "If you had worked a 12 hour shift with no breaks and your boss told you to order anything, would you pick X or something else?  Why?"

- Zoom in and Zoom Out.  Take your internal perspective THEN, ask an expert, find and look at data, base rates.  THEN add context and color.  Check that with your internal view.  It is critical to be honest with your self.
  - When working with experts aks them about the past and present.  Experts are not good at predicting the future.  Don't aks any predictive questions.
        >Go find an expert—someone more experienced than you. Just keep them talking about the past and the present, not the future.
- Go to the [Gemba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemba).  Go to the place and see the thing.  Go experience it for your self.  This practice add color and texture to your data.  Listen to experts, look at the data, conduct experiments AND! go see and touch, experience.

    > “Go and see what’s happening,” he told one. “See the end product of what we are doing. Talk to people; get the wind in your nose.” ~President Franklin D. Roosevelt  

- [Ooch](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ooch): In this context "To move or slide a small amount; scoot; scooch." Try out small things. The same concept is in [BE 2.0 by Jim Collins and Bill Lazier](./be_20.md) where they talk about hou you should Fire bullets then cannon balls.  Be warned that small steps are a way to Reality-Test Your Assumptions.  It can be over done and be a cop out at times.  You need to fire bullets THEN cannon balls.  Not fire just bullets.
    > TO OOCH IS TO ask, Why predict something we can test? Why guess when we can know?

#### Attain Distance Before Deciding

- Try the 10/10/10 rule.  How will I fell about this choice in 10 minutes, 10 days and 10 years from now?
    > 10/10/10 helps to level the emotional playing field. What we’re feeling now is intense and sharp, while the future feels fuzzier. That discrepancy gives the present too much power, because our present emotions are always in the spotlight.
- Be aware of mere exposure and loss aversion. They tend to sneak in when we are too close or act to fast.
- A simple question but it helps shift your thinking and gives you some distance.
- Gain distance by asking an outside perspective question:
  - What would I tell my best friend to do in this situation?
  - What would our successors do?
- Honor Your Core Priorities. First you have to know what they are. Then you can use them to gain perspective and distance.
- Ask what you would Stop Doing.  Create a Stop Doing list.

#### Prepare to Be Wrong

- Use Penstock Bookending.  The lower book end is a real world worst case, The High end is a real world best case.  Then find the sweet spot between the two bookends.
    >Fighting overconfidence means we’ve got to treat the future as a spectrum, not a point.
    >The future is not a “point”—a single scenario that we must predict. It is a range. We should bookend the future, considering a range of outcomes from very bad to very good.
- Use prospective hindsight.  Don't ask how might you predict the future, Instead ask Imagine that in the future X has happened. What would cause that?
- Use a premortem.
    >A premortem, by contrast, imagines the future “death” of a project and asks, “What killed it?”
- Run a Preparade.
    >A preparade asks us to consider success: Let’s say it’s a year from now and our decision has been a wild success. It’s so great that there’s going to be a parade in our honor. Given that future, how do we ensure that we’re ready for it?
- Consider a safety factor to compensate for overconfidence
    >To prepare for what can’t be foreseen, we can use a “safety factor.”
Heath, Chip; Heath, Dan. Decisive (p. 243). Crown. Kindle Edition. 
- Run a Realistic job preview
    >It’s easier to cope with setbacks when we’re mentally prepared for them.
- Set a TripWire.  If X happens then we should reconsider.  I have tried this and it has been extremely helpful!  You can combine this with a deadline.  By X date if we do not yet have Y we know something is wrong. You can also use a partition (some boundary around the choice) as a tripwire.   If we spend more than 2000.00 than we will X.   If we see Y behaver then we know X.

    > In another study, participants gambled less when their funds were spread across 10 envelopes, rather than crammed into a single envelope.

    > ALL THIS WORRYING ABOUT traps and contingencies may make tripwires sound overly cautious—the bicycle helmet of decision making. But actually we want to argue the opposite, that tripwires encourage risk taking by letting us carve out a “safe space” for experimentation.



## Procedural Justice


> “procedural justice”—i.e., the procedures used to make a decision were just—as distinct from “distributive justice,” which is concerned with whether the spoils of a decision were divvied up fairly. An extensive body of research confirms that procedural justice is critical in explaining how people feel about a decision. It’s not just the outcome that matters; it’s the process. 

1. Give people a chance to be heard.  And LISTEN!  Really Listen.  Level 3 listening.  This part matters!
1. Use good data that people agree on
1. Invite challenge and feedback
1. Avoid Bias by using the WRAP process and show how you are controlling for Bias.  Name it. Talk about it.
1. Explain why decision was made
1. Be honest about risks and trip wires.

> “sometimes the best way to defend a decision is to point out its flaws.”


## Quotes

> “Any time in life you’re tempted to think, ‘Should I do this OR that?’ instead, ask yourself, ‘Is there a way I can do this AND that?" ~Steve Cole

> Why a process? Because understanding our shortcomings is not enough to fix them.

> "We may spend 95% of our time going straight, but it’s the turns that determine where we end up." ~ Roy Baumeister

> Organizations seem to be using the same decision process as a hormone-crazed teenager.

> What if we started every decision by asking some simple questions: What are we giving up by making this choice? What else could we do with the same time and money?

> One rule of thumb is to keep searching for options until you fall in love at least twice.

> WHEN LIFE OFFERS US a “this or that” choice, we should have the gall to ask whether the right answer might be “both.”

> Warren Buffett said, “In the past, I’ve observed that many acquisition-hungry managers were apparently mesmerized by their childhood reading of the story about the frog-kissing princess. Remembering her success, they pay dearly for the right to kiss corporate toads, expecting wondrous transfigurations.” Unfortunately, said Buffett, “We’ve observed many kisses but very few miracles.”

> Isn’t that dehumanizing somehow? Overly analytical? The advice to trust the numbers isn’t motivated by geekery; it’s motivated by humility. We can’t lose sight of what the numbers represent: A lot of people like us—people full of passion for their opportunities—spent their time trying something very similar to what we’re contemplating. To ignore their experience isn’t brave and romantic—“I’m not going to let some analysis stand in the way of doing what I believe.” Rather, it’s egotistical. It’s saying, We set ourselves apart from everyone else. We’re different. We’re better.

> When we zoom out, we take the outside view, learning from the experiences of others who have made choices like the one we’re facing. When we zoom in, we take a close-up of the situation, looking for “color” that could inform our decision. Either strategy is helpful, and either one will add insight in a way that conference-room pontificating rarely will. When possible, we should do both[...] Zooming out and zooming in gives us a more realistic perspective on our choices. We downplay the overly optimistic pictures we tend to paint inside our minds and instead redirect our attention to the outside world, viewing it in wide-angle and then in close-up.

> Short-term emotion, which can be an unreliable adviser. When people share the worst decisions they’ve made in life, they are often recalling choices made in the grip of visceral emotion: anger, lust, anxiety, greed. Our lives would be very different if we had a dozen “undo” buttons to use in the aftermath of these choices.

> Some deadlines are backed by the force of law, such as the IRS’s April 15 deadline for submitting taxes, and it’s no shock that these deadlines are effective. What’s stranger is the effectiveness of made-up deadlines in getting us to do what would have been good for us anyway.

> So where do you want to spend your time? Bargaining up front, or fighting foot draggers later? Bargaining yields buy-in.

> A trustworthy process can help us navigate even the thorniest decisions.
