## Notes

### Moral Algebra

> In 1772, Benjamin Franklin was asked for advice by a colleague who’d been offered an unusual job opportunity. Franklin replied in a letter that, given his lack of knowledge of the situation, he couldn’t offer advice on whether or not to take the job. But he did suggest a process the colleague could use to make his own decision. Franklin said that his approach was “to divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns, writing over the one Pro and over the other Con.” During the next three or four days, Franklin said, he’d add factors to the two columns as they occurred to him. Then, he said: When I have thus got them all together in one view, I endeavour to estimate their respective weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a reason Pro equal to some two reasons Con, I strike out the three. If I judge some two reasons Con equal to some three reasons Pro, I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the balance lies; and if after a day or two of farther consideration nothing new that is of importance occurs on either side, I come to a determination accordingly.

Be warned.  Our biases gets in the way.

> Research in psychology over the last 40 years has identified a set of biases in our thinking that **doom the pros-and-cons model of decision making**. If we aspire to make better choices, then we must learn how these biases work and how to fight them (with something more potent than a list of pros and cons).

###

first villain of decision making, narrow framing, which is the tendency to define our choices too narrowly,


“confirmation bias,” is the second villain of decision making.

third villain of decision making: short-term emotion.

the fourth villain of decision making is overconfidence.




> Why a process? Because understanding our shortcomings is not enough to fix them.
