## Notes

### Four Villains of Decision Making

Be on the lookout for these villains.

- First: Narrow Framing, which is the tendency to define our choices too narrowly.
    Look for:
    - Whether **or** not
    - Sham options
    Defend with:
    - [Widen Your Options](#widen-your-options)
- Second: Confirmation Bias, Our normal habit in life is to develop a quick belief about a situation and then seek out information that bolsters our belief
- Third: Short-Term Emotion, We can get caught up in the History, Feelings or how we feel at the time
- Forth: overconfidence, When we are overconfident we tend to be wrong. 
    > The odds of a meltdown are one in 10,000 years. —Vitali Sklyarov, minister of power and electrification in the Ukraine, two months before the Chernobyl accident 
    
    > Who the hell wants to hear actors talk? —Harry Warner, Warner Bros. Studios, 1927 
    
    > What use could this company make of an electrical toy? —William Orton, president of the Western Union Telegraph Company, in 1876, rejecting an opportunity to purchase Alexander Graham Bell’s patent on the telephone

    > We have too much confidence in our own predictions. When we make guesses about the future, we shine our spotlights on information that’s close at hand, and then we draw conclusions from that information.

> - You encounter a choice. But narrow framing makes you miss options.
> - You analyze your options. But the confirmation bias leads you to gather self-serving information.
> - You make a choice. But short-term emotion will often tempt you to make the wrong one.
> - Then you live with it. But you’ll often be overconfident about how the future will unfold.

### Moral Algebra

> In 1772, Benjamin Franklin was asked for advice by a colleague who’d been offered an unusual job opportunity. Franklin replied in a letter that, given his lack of knowledge of the situation, he couldn’t offer advice on whether or not to take the job. But he did suggest a process the colleague could use to make his own decision. Franklin said that his approach was “to divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns, writing over the one Pro and over the other Con.” During the next three or four days, Franklin said, he’d add factors to the two columns as they occurred to him. Then, he said: When I have thus got them all together in one view, I endeavour to estimate their respective weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a reason Pro equal to some two reasons Con, I strike out the three. If I judge some two reasons Con equal to some three reasons Pro, I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the balance lies; and if after a day or two of farther consideration nothing new that is of importance occurs on either side, I come to a determination accordingly.

Be warned.  Our biases gets in the way.  The second villian shows up here all the time.

> Research in psychology over the last 40 years has identified a set of biases in our thinking that **doom the pros-and-cons model of decision making**. If we aspire to make better choices, then we must learn how these biases work and how to fight them (with something more potent than a list of pros and cons).

### Mindsets

- Prevention: Avoiding negative outcomes. 
- Promotion: Pursuing positive outcomes.

Toggle between the prevention and promotion mindsets.  And not Or.

### WRAP process

- **W**iden Your Options 
- **R**eality-Test Your Assumptions 
- **A**ttain Distance Before Deciding 
- **P**repare to Be Wrong

In no particular order.  

#### Widen Your Options
 - And not Or
- Multi-Track.  Consider multipal options at the same time.  Not linearly.  Not too many.  Avoid the choice paradox. Less than 5 is a good rule of thumb.
- Expand your real options
- State Opertunity Costs "Do you want the 1000.00 stero or the 700.00 one and 300.00 in new music?".  Say it out loud.
- Vanishing Options Test.  "Vanishing Options Test, which you can adapt to your situation: You cannot choose any of the current options you’re considering. What else could you do?"
- Take an outside perspective
- Look to see how the problem has already been sloved.  Ladder Up.  Look for local analogies, then regional analogies.  Dont go to far up the Ladder.
- Use or create playlits that help you expand your focus.

#### Reality-Test Your Assumptions
- Consider the Opposite
- Decenting views
    > CEO and chairman of General Motors, once interrupted a committee meeting with a question: “Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete agreement on the decision here?” All the committee members nodded. “Then,” Sloan said, “I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what this decision is about.”

#### Attain Distance Before Deciding

#### Prepare to Be Wrong


## Quotes

> “Any time in life you’re tempted to think, ‘Should I do this OR that?’ instead, ask yourself, ‘Is there a way I can do this AND that?" ~Steve Cole

> Why a process? Because understanding our shortcomings is not enough to fix them.

> "We may spend 95% of our time going straight, but it’s the turns that determine where we end up." ~ Roy Baumeister

> Organizations seem to be using the same decision process as a hormone-crazed teenager.

> What if we started every decision by asking some simple questions: What are we giving up by making this choice? What else could we do with the same time and money?

> One rule of thumb is to keep searching for options until you fall in love at least twice.

> WHEN LIFE OFFERS US a “this or that” choice, we should have the gall to ask whether the right answer might be “both.”

> Warren Buffett said, “In the past, I’ve observed that many acquisition-hungry managers were apparently mesmerized by their childhood reading of the story about the frog-kissing princess. Remembering her success, they pay dearly for the right to kiss corporate toads, expecting wondrous transfigurations.” Unfortunately, said Buffett, “We’ve observed many kisses but very few miracles.”
