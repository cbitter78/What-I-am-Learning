## Quotes

> "Trust is defined as choosing to risk  making something you value vulnerable to another personâ€™s actions."

> "Trust is critical for everyone who wants to work with others to accomplish  what is not possible to do alone. The great news is that building trust is a  competency, a set of skills that can be learned and improved."
