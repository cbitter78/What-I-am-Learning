## Notes

A friend and mentor gave me this book.  Its short but packed with really good stuff!  The advise in this book is very actionable.

`Trust = Care + Sincerity + Reliability + Competence`

## Quotes

> "Trust is defined as choosing to risk making something you value vulnerable to another person’s actions."

> "Distrust is essentially the opposite of trust in that it is a choice  not to make yourself vulnerable to another person’s actions. It is a general  assessment that; what is important to me is not safe with this person in this  situation (or any situation)." 

> "Distrust and fear go hand in hand. Whenever distrust of any kind creeps into  relationships in the workplace it produces attitudes and behaviors guaranteed  to undermine effective work, including suspicion, resistance, defensiveness,  interpersonal conflict, withholding of information, and overzealous checking  of others’ work. When distrust becomes part of an organization’s culture it  leads to increasingly elaborate and draconian control mechanisms. People’s  time, energy, and creativity are channeled into actions that may make them  feel somewhat safer, but do not produce what they really want and need – good  working relationships based on trust."

> "The disaster of distrust in the workplace is that  the strategies people use to protect themselves inevitably get in the way of their  ability to effectively work with others."

> "Having the trust of  those you work with is too important not to be intentional about  building and maintaining it."

> "Trust is critical for everyone who wants to work with others to accomplish  what is not possible to do alone. The great news is that building trust is a  competency, a set of skills that can be learned and improved."

> "The ways you act can help the people around you feel  fundamentally safe in your presence, they will also tend to trust you, feel a  sense of well-being, and think, analyze and problem-solve at their best  around you."

> "Distrust on a team is a performance killer just as it is between  two people. Except that a team’s goals are almost always larger and  more impactful for a company than those of any two individuals,  so when a team’s performance is hobbled by distrust the fallout is  far more damaging to the company."

> "Strong trust is part of the fabric of high performing teams."

> "Building trust requires being trustworthy"

> "Revoking or renegotiating a commitment should be done  as soon as you realize you will not be able to fulfill it."

> "When you don’t know something, say so and ask for help"

> "One of the most striking features of high-trust teams is the strong feeling  of camaraderie among team members. They may disagree, argue and debate  passionately about the best course of action. But they do so as a band of  comrades who in the end agree on and fully support a decision. The thing is,  throughout the process they take great joy in being with each other, something  anyone who watches them in action can readily sense. They clearly trust and  respect on another even when they disagree. They have fun"

> "As Simons’ studies and other research on employee engagement show,  there is direct value in maintaining high trust at work. People who are deeply  engaged in their work feel committed to and positive about what they are doing  and those they are doing it with. They also tend to derive a positive sense of  purpose from their work. Yet people fail to have intentional conversations  to build and maintain trust even when they believe trust is low. Instead they  pretend outwardly that trust exists even though they know it doesn’t. Authors  of the book, Building Trust, Robert Solomon and Fernando Flores, call this  cordial hypocrisy."

> "The only known antidote for betrayal of someone’s trust is to  acknowledge it and apologize for it."

> "Relationships built on strong, healthy mutual trust are essential to both  success and greater well-being in our companies, government and social  institutions, as well as our communities and families."

> "Half the promises people say were never kept were never made.  — Edgar Watson Howe"
