## Notes

This book was recommended to me by a mentor of mine. I do mentoring work with woman in technology and this book gave
me a perspective I needed to improve.   This book is NOT just for women.  Everyone needs to read this book.
 
This book references [What got you here, Won't get you there](./what_got_you_here_wont_get_you_there.md).  You should read both.
