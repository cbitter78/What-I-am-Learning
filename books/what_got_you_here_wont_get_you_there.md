## Notes

This book was recommended to me by a mentor of mine. I needed to read this book.  It was very hard for me to read because I suddenly saw that I had some habits that were holding me back.   This mentor was kind enough to work with me as I read this book to ensure I gave myself some space and time to help improve.  We made a plan and worked on one thing at a time.   This book changed my life.  You should read it.   Twice!
