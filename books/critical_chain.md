## Notes

First, I think its awesome that Goldratt totally tolls the higher education community.  It turns out in 1997 when this was published that collages suffered from the same problems that they do in 2023.  That aside, this is a fun novel that takes you though how to manage bottle necks and buffers.  This is not everything you need to manage flow.  It is an excellent dive into one some of the tools you need.  See [Rules of Flow](./rules_of_flow.md)
