I read this book because it was cited in [Making work visible](./making_work_visible.md).  I was
interested in the [A3 design method](https://kanbantool.com/kanban-guide/a3-problem-solving).  In Chapter 40 there is some good advise on A10
 
I was also curious to see how Lean and agile was applied in other domains such as construction and design
I found quite a few similarities and some unique ideas.
 
## Notes

There were some cool ideas in this book I have not seen in Software Devlopment.  They are:

### A3 Design

I like this as a way to create a high level view of a design or problem.

### Risk and Opportunity Register

I like this as a way to encourage people to find opportunities and call out risks.

### Choosing by Advantages

I like this as a framework and methodology to choosing one thing over the other.

Choosing by Advantages is based upon the following four principles:

1. The foundation principle of sound decision making: Sound methods base decisions on the importance of prospective differences among the alternatives—not factors, criteria, goals, roles, categories, objectives, attributes, pros and cons, and so forth. (This principle was recognized and validated at least three centuries ago.) 
2. The fundamental rule of sound decision making: Sound methods base decisions on the importance of advantages—not advantages and disadvantages. (An advantage is a difference between the attributes of two alternatives.) 
3. The principle of anchoring: Sound methods anchor decisions to the relevant facts. (In the CBA vocabulary, methods that do not base decisions on the relevant facts are called unsound methods.) 
4. The pivotal (critically important) sound–decision-making principle: Engineers, architects, leaders in organizations, and so forth are professional decision makers. They need to learn and skillfully use sound methods of decision making.
